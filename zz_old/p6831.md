[Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) — wikipedia says was published in May 2009

double-spending problem: when someone spends digital currency, check to see if someone else spent it first.  
\* timestamps are recorded by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without re-doing the proof-of-work.  
\* Assumes a majority of trustworthy actors: The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they’ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  
\* Peer-to-peer network: nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

Identity and authenticity on the Internet has relied on institutions serving as trusted third parties. The block chain is a peer-authenticated chain-of-trust where the “peer” is ? actually a collection/network of peers?
