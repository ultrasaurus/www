<p>E-mail provides a lot of interesting UI challenges and opportunities. Lately there has been a lot of innovation in this area, both on the web and on the desktop. People use e-mail everyday. For many, it has become the center of their online experience. Even though web mail is missing some features of desktop mail applications, more and more people are moving to web-based mail because of the convenience of it being available on any computer you happen to be near.</p>
<p>Its exciting to see this project unveiled. I’ve been working on it for a while with my colleagues at Laszlo. Using LZX, we have been able to take a structured and modular approach to the problem. Its easy to focus on one class or area of the app with specific test files, getting that one part to work smoothly, then its pretty rewarding to see the larger application evolve. For me, it has really validated what I already believed — that the OpenLaszlo platform is ideal for building complex applications and creating a great web experience.</p>
