<h1>Brand New Weblog</h1>

<p>It was much easier installing moveabletype into this media temple account than it was getting it up and running on my Windows machine at home. I always like to have a local version of software to play with and it has been fun (in a geeky sort of way) getting to know the archane rites of MySql, perl, Apache, and whatnot.</p>
<p>Many thanks to<br>
– the people of the opensource movement who wrote all this software<br>
– Ric, who I don’t know, but who wrote a great <a href="http://www.ricocheting.com/server/">tutorial </a>for setting up a windows server<br>
– <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net">media temple </a>for making it even easier than that<br>
– and lastly, <a href="http://www.klynch.com">Kevin Lynch</a>, who is always an inspiration, but specifically, in this instance, pointed me toward Moveable Type and, perhaps unknowingly, inspired me to create my own blog.</p>
