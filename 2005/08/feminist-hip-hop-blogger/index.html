<h1>Feminist hip-hop blogger</h1>

<p><em>August 05, 2005</em></p>


<p>I was intrigued by this <a href="blogher.org">blogher</a> session with the subtitle: “negotiating a space dominated by men.” As a software engineer, I often find myself the lone woman in a roomfull of men. I was interested in the perspective of a woman in a completely different industry facing a similar gender imbalance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lynnedjohnson.com/">Lynne D. Johnson</a> gave a fantastic presentation which unexpectedly challenged some of my own assumptions about rap lyrics. I enjoy hip hop — the music, the poetry of the lyrics — but I have felt disturbed and alienated by some music of that genre which has explicit lyrics which degrade women and celebrate violence. It was enlightening to hear from a woman in the industry.</p>
<p>She spoke about starting to blog without a particular topic in mind, just about her thoughts and reflections on life. She became known as a “feminist hip hop blogger” without seeking that as role because she sometimes wrote from a feminist perspective about hip hop. Its funny how an audience can set their own expectations for a writer. I like hearing about how she thinks about staying true to her own voice.</p>
<p>Lynne spoke about being challenged as a woman in a powerful role (as an editor of Spin and Vibe) that she and other sisters were not outspoken enough against mysoginistic lyrics. She responded with a thoughful post, <a href="http://www.lynnedjohnson.com/diary/000428.html">who’s gonna’ take the weight?</a>, that cites many excellent articles written on the subject. In particular, she posted in its entirety an essay by Bell Hooks, “Misogyny, gangsta rap, and The Piano,” ZMagazine, February 1994.</p>
<p>Bell Hooks notes that “gangsta rap as a reflection of dominant values in our culture rather than as an aberrant ‘pathologica’ standpoint…Rather than being viewed as a subversion or disruption of the norm we would need to see it as an embodiment of the norm.”</p>
<p>Isolated in my bourgeois, predominantly white world, where mysogyny is discussed in safe discussions amongst the like-minded, it never occurred to me that these young black men are just telling it like it is. George Fox, one of the founding Quakers, did not merely create a creed of non-violent action in his peace testimony; he spoke about taking away “the occasion of all wars.” Could we take away from our society the underlying currents of hatred and violence that produce such lyrics?</p>
