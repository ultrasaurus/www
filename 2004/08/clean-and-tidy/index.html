<p><em>August 29, 2004</em></p>


<p>I feel so much better with blog comments once again swept clean. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">Jay Allen’s MT Blacklist</a>. The new release addresses the latest comment spammer scheme that was frustrating me. The installation was ridiculously easy and I was so pleased that I’ve sent him a PayPal donation.</p>
<p>I had heard that people use blog spam to raise their Google ranking — I can’t imagine that they get many click thrus. I had the opportunity earlier this year to hear <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> speak from Google. After the talk I asked him whether Google had a response to comment spammers. He said that Google had just implemented something to make it so that urls in blog comments did not contribute to rank. I had hoped that over time comment spam would diminish, but it seems to have increased. Adam Kalsey writes about a <a href="http://kalsey.com/blog/2004/07/new_comment_spam_technique/">new comment spam technique</a>. I suppose its a perpetual battle between the people who create systems and those who seek to abuse them.</p>
