<h1>Laszlo Systems named &amp;#8220;Cool Vendor&amp;#8221;</h1>

<p>Gartner has Laszlo Systems one of four “Cool Vendors in Application Development” for 2007. Highlights from the report…</p>
<p>Whereas,<br>
* Software development remains difficult and demanding.<br>
* The collaboration and coordination of projects is creating demand for higher levels of integration.<br>
* Tools that simplify the process of programming by creating a higher level of abstraction may break some of the barriers for development and remain an area of innovation.</p>
<p><strong>OpenLaszlo is cool because</strong> it is the only RIA platform in which developers can define the user<br>
interface in a declarative (nonprocedural) manner and target different runtime environments,<br>
including Ajax, Flash and Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition (Java for mobile devices). Although<br>
many vendors are using a declarative XML representation for the interface (including Adobe,<br>
Microsoft and Nexaweb), no other vendor enables this XML to be rendered to as many different<br>
runtimes.</p>
<p>Laszlo has been able to land some flagship customers, such as Wal-Mart, Barclays, H&amp;R Block,<br>
Time and Monster.com. It also has partnerships with IBM and Sun.</p>
