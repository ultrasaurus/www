Originally drafted: Jan 1, 2011

Two years ago, I decided to quit my nice job with a steady paycheck and [go solo](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/02/going-solo/). I had my first consulting gig lined up and my goal was to make just enough money working on fun projects that allowed me to learn new tech while finding or creating my next startup. That first consulting gig became my [next startup](http://www.mightyverse.com/) just 9 months later, but in the meantime, something else happened. My solo consulting turned into a successful business of its own. Before I ever heard of Eric Ries and Lean Startup, I decided that I would engage in agile business development.

My initial business goals were clear. Consulting was a mercenary effort with the goal of buying myself time OR I would take on a less profitable gig that let me learn something new or explore a larger opportunity. I figured I had certain skills that I would leverage most. As an expert OpenLaszlo / Javascript developer with deep expertise in web video and plently of industry connections, I was confident I could find work and planned to look in familiar territory. I had no business name, no website (aside from this whimsically titled personal weblog), and I didn’t print business cards. I decided I would only do for the business things that would clearly drive business. If it wasn’t painful, if it wasn’t impeding my goals of making money and learning, then it wasn’t necessary.

**Q209** My 6 week gig turned into a 3 month gig, a small OpenLaszlo project transformed into a large Ruby on Rails project. It held all of the thrill and fear of jumping of high cliffs into water that I love so much. I was delightfully overwhelmed in new tech in a way that I had not experienced since I dove into the web in 1995. Here there was a community outspoken in email groups and blogs that felt welcoming and familiar as long as I was coding alone or [pair programming](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/07/pair-programming-velocity/) in my home office. When I started showing up in person, it was a little odd. I felt like an outsider because of my gender. And I figured if I felt weird, with 20 years of software development, having invented technologies which influenced what people experience on the web, tv and in the movies, I could imagine what a novice engineer who happened to be a woman (or another minority) would feel like. Besides I was tired of being the only woman in the room, as was commonly my experience as a Director of Engineering in corporate negotiations. As a coder, in a small community, with hot technology, I figured it didn’t have to be that way. So, Sarah Mei and I cooked up this idea of making a difference and changing SF Ruby. It actually took less than a year to move the needle. In the first half of 2009, my consulting business afforded me spare time, which let me teach programming to kids, lead workshops for women, and continue to contribute to open source. I joined the board of RailsBridge when it started. All the little projects added up and my spare time evaporated. While weeds overtook my garden at home, I stopped trying to create work-life balance. I needed to give myself time to figure this stuff out.

Mid-2009, a tweet from [@rands](http://twitter.com/rands) changed the trajectory of my consulting business. I had planned to seek opportunities around what I knew well. Then I looked at the infographic below and in the area where “what we do well” and “what we can be paid to do” overlapped, it read “learn to say no.”

I decided at that moment to shift my focus to monetize or learn to do better what I want to do. I wanted to work on hot new tech that would be relevant for the next decade or so. I decided to focus on mobile development. I spent half my time learning and half my time going after gigs where I could apply my new skills. Learning to say “no” to working on what I did well was very hard, yet that is what gave me time to stretch myself and gain experience with new technologies. Through consulting and getting involved with the local tech community, I developed my skills, hired a team and grew Blazing Cloud into a successful consulting business focused on mobile.
