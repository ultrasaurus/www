<h1>leapmotion tracks all ten fingers</h1>

<p>At SXSW, I joined Laura Sydell (<a href="https://twitter.com/Sydell">@Sydell</a>) for NPR interview: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/03/11/173958670/controlling-your-computer-with-a-wave-of-your-hand">controlling your computer with a wave of your hand.</a> The <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> controller detects the motion of all five fingers as you comfortably wave them in the air above the device — you can even use both hands! Currently available for pre-order for $79.88, this device is a clear fit for 3D modeling applications and games. While professional 3D modelers will always require precision controls, it is exciting to imagine the ability to create fluid, whimsical forms or animated effects, where a complex curve could be created with natural hand motion.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 13px">Along with games from Disney Interactive, DoubleFine and ZeptoLab, </span><a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/press_releases/leap-motion-controller-set-to-ship-may-13-for-global-pre-orders-in-best-buy-stores-may-19">Leap Motion has announced</a><span style="font-size: 13px"> that Corel’s Painter apps and 3D software from Autodesk will support the device. In the interview, I talk about an application for this device that would have broad consumer appeal. Combined with a 3D printer, either in the home or as a service, we can imagine preparing for a celebration by sitting down at a “virtual potting wheel” and creating a vase for your parents’ anniversary party or teacups for your kid’s birthday, then you could choose a photo or drawing to decorate the object. You can already upload these virtual 3D objects to printing services which will ship them to you — you may even spend less than you would on other party favors and entertainments.</span></p>
