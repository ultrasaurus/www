<h1>feast of St. Laszlo</h1>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Laszlo-ChroniconPictum.jpg/114px-Laszlo-ChroniconPictum.jpg" alt=""> Today we honor St. Laszlo, Ladislaus I, King of Hungary 1077-1095. Laszlo successfully repelled many attempts to invade Hungary, encouraged Christian missionaries, and built many churches, but allowed religious freedom to the Jews and Mohammedans in his realms. While many Hungarians regarded him as a Saint many years before, it was not until June 27, 1192 that his Sainthood was recognized by the Church.</p>
<p>Laszlo Systems held a humble feast today in honor of Saint Laszlo. Amidst the festivities, the assembled congregation canonized St. Laszlo as the Patron Saint of User Experience.<br>
