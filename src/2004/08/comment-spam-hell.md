I’ve been effectively managing my comment spam with [Jay Allen’s Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/), but the spammer have a new tactic where they add urls with entity references (www.online-casinos-choice.com) which aren’t caught by Jay’s software.

I don’t have time at the moment to investigate and resolve this, so I’m turning off comments on new entries and closed the most attacked entries. I’m sure there are a number of good solutions to this, but I don’t have time to investigate at the moment. If anyone has a suggestion for me or wants to send me a comment, you can use my [feedback form](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/emailme.php).
