InformationWeek [reports](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/11/google_adds_vid_1.html;jsessionid=VJY03MBID00RAQSNDLRSKH0CJUNN2JVN) on google’s new [voice and video chat](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/talk-face-to-face-right-from-within.html). Since I gotta check all all the new video tech, I dove right in. Hmm… who do I know who uses a gmail account who will be logged in right now?

So, I open gmail to check out my contacts, of which I have none. But, lo and behold, I can use my AOL buddy list. I sign in and ping my friend (name omitted to protect the innocent):

ultrasaurus03 (6:52:12 PM): yt?  
friend (6:53:48 PM): Yes.  
friend (6:53:51 PM): Youre’ okay with this?  
friend (6:53:53 PM): “Your IM conversation with ultrasaurus03 will be saved in ultrasaurus03’s IM history in Gmail from now on. Learn more at http://x.aim.com/gmail.”

OK, kindly big brother google is now tracking my every thought. Not an issue for this experiment, but duly noted.

Friend agrees to participate in my random technology experience. I tell him to hang on and I choose the video option. Ack! now I need to install…

Good thing I’m running Windows XP. It actually takes more than a few seconds to install…

maybe a minute or so…

but then I need to restart my browser.

Whew! I’m back. I login to gmail… and …

oh, gee. Not only do I need to have XP, but my friend does too. Time to find another friend.

Ok, now I’ve pinged another friend (via AIM) who has XP. He signs up for a gmail account. We add each other to our buddy lists. Then he installs the software. Whew.

Now we’re ready to chat… after one weird interaction (or lack thereof):

We’re actually communicating:

It’s a bit weird that it doesn’t seem to know he doesn’t have a camera — I really don’t need a large blank box on my screen while we have an audio conversation, but the quality of the audio is really quite good. I’m using the sucky built-in mic on my laptop but it doesn’t seem to be an issue like it is on some systems.

The official [Google blog says](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/talk-face-to-face-right-from-within.html) “Gmail voice and video chat will be rolled out globally over the next day or so for Macs and PCs” — that was 3 days ago and no Mac version yet, but it is good to hear it is coming.

Interesting that Google chose to use audio-video technology from [Vidyo](http://www.vidyo.com/) rather than the ubiquitous Flash video. I would guess the decision not to use Flash stemmed from the superior audio conversation experience, since they did go with Flash video for the Google video site.
