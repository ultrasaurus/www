<h1>Making eBay Better with Open Laszlo</h1>

<p>There’s a nice <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Stewart/?p=25">zdnet article</a> about <a href="http://www.cooqy.com">cooqy</a>, an eBay site developed using <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org">OpenLaszlo</a> by Robert Yeager . “After taking a look at AJAX, Flash and traditional web development platforms, he settled on OpenLazslo. According to him it was because it was a mature product as well as free and open source. OpenLaszlo’s elegant XML-based programming model was a big plus and made for rapid development. Cooqy went from nothing to core functionality in 4 weeks of part time work.”</p>

<p>I found the app compelling, and imediately got sucked into shopping-mode by the “photo collage” view. It must be a very successful application where I can get distracted by my usual analysis of the UI and Web 2.0-iness of it all to instead be enticed to actually *use* the application :)</p>
<p>I’m thinking of buying a few pounds of legos:<br>
