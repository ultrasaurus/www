I’m thrilled to be part of the [Women 2.0 Startup Weekend Documentary](http://www.women2.org/watch-the-women-2-0-startup-weekend-documentary/): Start Something. Filmed as a student project with San Francisco State University’s Digital Video Intensive program, Start Something follows three groups of entrepreneurs as they navigate Startup Weekend, a three day event where entrepreneurs come together to share ideas, form teams and launch startups.

Produced by Dave Kochbeck, directed by Doug Latimer, and edited by Joseph McDonald, this film captures the excitement, frustration and serendipity of the startup experience which is the essence of [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org/). In these 54-hour events, developers, coders, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and create startups! While most startups created at these weekend events don’t continue, the people at the events often go on to create or join other startup companies — or take their startup skills to fuel innovation in their day jobs.

Many thanks to the [Kaufman Foundation](http://www.kauffman.org), the [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org/) crew, and all the prospective entrepreneurs who show up.
