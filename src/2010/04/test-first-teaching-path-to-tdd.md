Over the past year I’ve taught about a dozen sessions of Ruby language or Ruby on Rails programming classes. I’ve been using a combination of presentation, live coding demonstration, follow along with irb (Ruby’s interactive scripting environment) and [test-first teaching exercises](http://testfirst.org). I’ve reflected on what works well and experimented with curriculum and teaching style modifications for the sections where students struggled. I’ve found a sequence which works very effectively. I believe it could be applied to teaching any programming language, and perhaps to teaching anything.

1. **Conceptual Overview** A presentation of the concept: why it is important, what it can do, how it works. How it fits into the bigger picture (if applicable). Pictures and diagrams are great here.
2. **Experimentation (Play)** My goal in this section is to create a feeling of play… at best, with grown-ups, I think I’ve achieved a sense of experimentation or, perhaps, what the Talent Code calls “deep practice”
3. **Demonstration of a Real-World Example** A live coding demonstration that solves a real problem. I often use this as an opportunity to test-drive the example, which illustrates the concept from two angles: the test (expectation) and implementation.
4. **Simple hands-on exercise** Test first teaching examples where the student is given a test that fails and they have to apply what they just learned to write code and make the test pass.

This was the context of my talk tonight at the [East Bay Ruby Meetup](http://ruby.meetup.com/81/calendar/12145157/). I talked about teaching methodologies, demonstrated a test-first exercise, then talked about moving on to test-driven development.
