XML, noun: A magic elixir of legend, claiming to solve all problems while inevitably exacting an ironic cost.

“Once we drink the XML and take care of a few minor things — parser, DTD, entification, well-formed-ness, validation, namespaces, I18N, XSL transformations, schemas — all will be peaceful in the kingdom!”
