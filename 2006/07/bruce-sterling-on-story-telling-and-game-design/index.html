<h1>Bruce Sterling on Story Telling and Game Design</h1>

<p>I just read <a href="http://lib.ru/STERLINGB/story.txt">Bruce Sterling. The Wonderful Power of Storytelling</a> via <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?362">Luke W</a>. I believe that storytelling is a powerful element of great software design, and probably game design as well (although I’m no game designer). Despite his contrarian argument, I enjoyed reading his talk. Here are some highlights:</p>
<p><font size="+1">“Don’t become a well-rounded person. Well rounded people are smooth and dull. Become a thoroughly spiky person. Grow spikes from every angle. Stick in their throats like a pufferfish.”</font></p>
<p>He paraphrases what he calls the the classic doctrine of Humanist SF as it applies to computer game design:<br>
<em>“Movies and plays get much of their power from the resonances<br>
between the structural layers. The congruence between the theme,<br>
plot, setting and character layouts generates emotional power.<br>
Computer games will never have a significant theme level because<br>
the outcome is variable. The lack of theme alone will limit the<br>
storytelling power of computer games.</em></p>
<p>“Hard to refute. Impossible to refute. Ladies and gentlemen to<br>
hell with the marvellous power of storytelling. If the audience<br>
for science fiction wanted *storytelling*, they wouldn’t read<br>
goddamned *science fiction,* they’d read Harpers and Redbook and<br>
Argosy. The pulp magazine (which is our genre’s primary example<br>
of a dead platform) used to carry all kinds of storytelling.<br>
Western stories. Sailor stories. Prizefighting stories. G-8 and<br>
his battle aces. Spicy Garage Tales. Aryan Atrocity Adventures.<br>
These things are dead. Stories didn’t save them. Stories won’t<br>
save us. Stories won’t save *you.*</p>
<p>“This is not the route to follow. We’re not into science fiction<br>
because it’s *good literature,* we’re into it because it’s<br>
*weird*. Follow your weird, ladies and gentlemen. Forget trying<br>
to pass for normal. Follow your geekdom. Embrace your nerditude.<br>
In the immortal words of Lafcadio Hearn, a geek of incredible<br>
obscurity whose work is still in print after a hundred years,<br>
“woo the muse of the odd.” A good science fiction story is not a<br>
“good story” with a polite whiff of rocket fuel in it. A good<br>
science fiction story is something that knows it is science<br>
fiction and plunges through that and comes roaring out of the<br>
other side. Computer entertainment should not be more like<br>
movies, it shouldn’t be more like books, it should be more like<br>
computer entertainment, SO MUCH MORE LIKE COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT<br>
THAT IT RIPS THROUGH THE LIMITS AND IS SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO<br>
IGNORE!”</p>
