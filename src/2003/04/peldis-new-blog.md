I am happy to report that Giacomo ‘Peldi’ Guilizzoni has started a [blog](http://www.peldi.com/blog).

The most recent [post](http://www.peldi.com/blog/000005.html) with his “peopleboard” component is a great example of an innovative way to display presence. As the internet evolves with an ever-increasing number of continuously connected computers, awareness of presence emerges as an important user interface concept.

Developers of Flash Communication Server applications will be excited to see that he has provided a number of cool components for download.
