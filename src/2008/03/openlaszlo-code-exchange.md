There is a new [OpenLaszlo code exchange](http://www.laszlocode.com) which the folks at [Mobile Data Now](http://www.mobiledatanow.com) have put together (via [Antun Karlovac](http://www.antunkarlovac.com)). It is great to see this kind of initiative from the OpenLaszlo community.

I wonder if we can dig up an archive of [mylaszlo.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20040705034047/www.mylaszlo.com/) (only partially available on the Internet archive and make that source more easily available again.
