<h1>recognizing leadership on ada lovelace day</h1>

<p><em>March 25, 2010</em></p>


<p>In honor of <a href="http://findingada.com">Ada Lovelace Day</a>, I’ve chosen to highlight Amy Chen and <a href="http://twobanjos.com/">Melanie Archer</a>. These two amazing women have agreed to lead the next <a href="http://sfrubyworkshops.com">SFRuby Outreach Workshop for Women</a>. They are each strong developers, but I also want to acknowledge their ability and willingness to take on a leadership role.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.linkedin.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_80_80/p/3/000/02e/346/2f79222.jpg" alt="">Melanie Archer attended the first workshop in June ’09 and has volunteered ever since. Her main professional focus is front-end HTML, CSS and Javascript, but she has worked consistently to help make these events happen, taking on some of the critical behind-the-scenes jobs that glue an event together. I’m so excited that she has agreed to take on a leadership role.</p>
<p>I got to know Amy Chen through her volunteering at the most recent <a href="http://sfrubyworkshops.com/2010/03/workshops-continue-in-2010/">worshop</a>. She agreed to “shadow” me during this event in preparation for leading the next workshop with Melanie. We got to talking about Javascript and I mentioned how I did test-driven Ruby, but had never done that with Javascript. She said she had done a lot of work with Selenium and somehow we hatched the idea of an evening workshop. At the last minute I turned it into a fundraiser since the February outreach workshop didn’t break even. She hadn’t taught Selenium before, nor given a hands-on training in this format, but she stepped up. I had so much fun in one of her prep sessions creating my first-ever test-driven jQuery… so cool. She even volunteered to teach a crew of interns I was training that week, since I had come to the realization that Javascript, HTML and CSS were as essential a foundation as is the Ruby language and SQL to a Rails engineer. The Selenium workshop was a success and I look forward to seeing Amy join Melanie in leading the next Outreach workshop.</p>
