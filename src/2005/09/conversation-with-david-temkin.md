Scott Mace conducts an interesting [interview](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail703.html) with David Temkin, CTO of Laszlo Systems. ” Before AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) had a name, there was Laszlo Systems…” They talk a bit of the company’s history, particularly Laszlo’s decision to release the platform under an open source license, and about where Laszlo is headed with the development of [Laszlo Mail](http://www.laszlosystems.com/products/laszloMail/) and other applications.
