A must see event…

[Invisible Computers: The Untold Story of the ENIAC Programmers](http://eniacprogrammers.org).  
Thursday, November 8, 2007 6pm  
Google Headquarters  
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  
Mountain View, CA 94043

This is a fundraiser for Kathy Kleiman to complete a full-length film telling this important story. I saw this short film at Grace Hopper many years ago. Last year, when I was doing research on ideas for our elementary school technology classes, I remembered the stories of these innovative early programmers, who received little or no recognition of their significant technical achievements at the time. I wanted kids today to realize what I didn’t know until I was all grown up and a programmer myself. I had no idea of the strong women innovators who came before me.

If you enjoyed reading about [Mary Houbolt](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000323.html), one of the first generation of human “computers,” you must come to this event. Even if you can’t come, please, please blog about this one. This is a very important fundraiser. The full-length movie absolutely must get made, so that these stories can be told to a wider audience and future generations.

Please [register](http://www.google.com/events/eniac/checkout.html) for this event if you can come and forward the info to people you know who might be interested. If you can’t come, but still want to support the making of this documentary, you can also make a [donation](http://www.google.com/events/eniac/checkout.html).
