“Furthering their commitment to continuous innovation, Internet leaders SBC Communications Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. today introduced exciting new customer-driven features…” One of these is a new personalization tools that leverages the [Laszlo Presentation Server](http://www.laszlosystems.com).

[ ![](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/yahoo/sbcyahoo_frontpage.jpg)](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/yahoo/sbcyahoo_frontpage.jpg)Your average human will not recognize this as a sexy rich internet app — it’s just too darn useful. You can’t see it in action unless you are a SBC Yahoo! subscriber, but those of you who are may remember dozens of pages spread across various yahoo properties that used to be the way to modify your site settings.

It’s nice to see this kind of technology used in such a practical, helpful manner.
