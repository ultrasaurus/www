<h1>web video interviews from bloggingheads.tv</h1>

<p><a href="http://bloggingheads.tv">bloggingheads.tv</a> offers an interesting format for interviews where you see the interviewer and interviewee side-by-side, which they call a diavlog (a term I can’t quite imagine using in conversation). The interviews appear to be recorded with webcams and a phone call.</p>
<p>They offer some neat playback features: the ability to link into a video (but I don’t see that I can make my own link) and the ability to playback the auido/video at a faster speed, which is surprisingly usable (although I wish I had a scrubber interface for the speed of the video, rather than simply the “1.4” button which appears to switch playback to an alternate video file).</p>
<p>I enjoyed listening to bits of a few interviews. The one below was fun, although it starts slow, you can start in the middle <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/15721?in=00:41:51&amp;out=00:51:28">what’s the point of sex?</a> which discusses some scientific perspectives on the topic. The parts about free will and the placebo effect were pretty interesting too.<br>
