<h1>cucumber and custom rspec matchers with rails 3.1</h1>

<p>I’m working my way through an epic Rails 3.1 upgrade and some of my cucumber features were failing because I was using a custom RSpec matcher and the method wasn’t found.</p>
<p>My custom matcher looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>
module CustomMatchers

  class XmlSubsetMatcher
      :
  end

  def be_xml_subset_of(expected)
    XmlSubsetMatcher.new(expected)
  end
</code></pre>
<p>and when I ran my feature I was getting this failure:<br>
<code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;      undefined method </code>xml_subset_of?' for # (NoMethodError)<br></br>`</p>
<p>As it turns out, in my zeal to make sure everything was using the latest and great new stuff, I had forgotten to move over this critical configuration line in cucumbers env.rb:</p>
<p><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;World(CustomMatchers)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now, my cucumber feature is happily failing cuz my code doesn’t work. Whew. I couldn’t find this documented anywhere and I’m not even sure where this documentation would belong. I found a hint on the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/RSpec-Expectations">cucumber wiki rspec expectations page</a>, but none of the code on that page is actually needed when using cucumber with Rails, so I decided not to touch it and just write this blog post.</p>
