I believe that every human has the potential to be a great leader. Some people are naturally drawn to the role: they want to be in front, in the spotlight, be listened to and admired. Some of us are drawn to leadership of necessity: we see the thing that needs to happen, the course that needs correcting. There’s no one else who will do it, so we step up.

Technical leadership is especially important these days, since software development is a team sport. Perhaps a more apt metaphor is a jazz band (via [@bmogilefsky](https://twitter.com/bmogilefsky)) that encourages every member the opportunity to improvise on a theme, creating a performance that unique, beautiful and resonates with the audience.

What is leadership?
-------------------

The dictionary defines a leader, as someone who leads, and the verb [to lead](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lead?s=t) is:

- to act as a guide; to show the way
- to go first; to be in advance
- to result in; to tend toward
- to influence, induce or cause

At its simplest, a leader is someone people will follow.  
[Modern research](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.163621) suggests that when we seek to understand leadership, we need to include the leader, follower, and context.

Leaders inspire with a vision of a long term outcome, then help to move toward that. [Leadership doesn’t look like architecture](https://twitter.com/ultrasaurus/status/700626187731611648). You don’t make blueprints and construct it. It emerges from an educated populace.

True leadership is often quiet and sometime unnoticed.  
Leadership is reporting the bug, after you already have found a workaround. You develop capabilities, not just of yourself, but of the people and systems around you. Leadership is growing the skills and responsibilities of the people you work with, so they can do more, and eventually you all can do new things.

You give space for the quiet voices to be heard. You don’t need to be a manager, but you can’t lead people who don’t have the support to excel. You mentor. You write, and you teach.

\*\* You seek to understand the real skills of your team. \*\*

There are weird forces at work that make it hard sometimes for people to self-assess.

There’s the **Dunning–Kruger effect**, a cognitive bias by which relatively unskilled individuals mistakenly assess their own ability to be much higher than it really is. Their skills are so weak that they can’t recognize their own ineptitude – they don’t understand the field and therefore have an illusion of superiority. Whereas highly skilled individuals often underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks which are easy for them are also easy for others.

In stark contrast, there’s the well-known **imposter syndrome** where very talented and skilled individuals are unable to internalize their own excellence, causing them to dismiss their own accomplishments.

You need to be expert at cutting through the bullshit. You need to know (or guess) what your team is capable of. Your expectations have impact.

[Interpersonal Expectancy Effect](http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/interpersonal_expectancy.htm): The way we act towards others depends on how we perceive them, and we can actually cause people to succeed or fail based on how we treat them. Even when we’re trying not to behave differently, what we believe affects the performance of others.

As a technical leader, you set expectations for success. You know the ones who tell you it’ll take a day, but they don’t count testing, documentation and deployment and others who will deliver production-ready code within their estimate. Figure out a way for them to joyfully deliver together. Give the one time to learn what done really feels like, and give the other the chance to show off early success.

Technical Leadership
--------------------

Technical leadership has 4 key attributes: judgement, vision, communication, and attention to detail.

### Judgement

A key skill of a technical leader is good judgement: being able to balance options, make decisions, understand the tensions between different criteria and to know where to draw the line.

Linus Torvalds say “It’s a thing I call *taste*.”

> I tend to judge the people I work with not by how proficient they are: some people can churn out a \_lot\_ of code, but more by how they react to other peoples code, and then obviously by what their own code \_looks\_ like, and what approaches they chose. That tells me whether they have “good taste” or not, and the thing is, a person without “good taste” often is not very good at judging other people’s code, but his own code often ends up not being wonderfully good.

I love the feel of that, but if you haven’t yet acquired good taste, it isn’t very helpful.

I like how Rebecca Parsons describes technical judgement:

> We need to consider the life-cycle cost of the software we write, taking into account the short-term value that the business can derive and the long-term costs of maintaining that code.

I don’t believe that maintenance is the right metaphor for software, but agree that thinking about it having a life-cycle helps frame the decisions we make. We need to figure out the choices that will make the software thrive.

### Vision

Technical leaders have a clear vision of where we are going and the path to get there.

### Communication Skills

Writing, speaking, and interpersonal communication: you need to not only have a vision and know how to get there, but you need to convey your ideas effectively to individuals and to large and small groups of people.

When asked about the most important skill every programmer should posses. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, talked about the ability to think clearly: “A programmer has to understand problems and express solutions.”

### Attention to Detail

When you make change, you have different approaches you can take. Are you going to re-model? or dig a new foundation?

Be intentional about decisions: whether it’s about that big re-write or migration, or about how you define roles and process. Make shit up that matters. (Just this morning Brian Fox was showing us his pwny award. How do I know I’m Firebase user #23? it’s on the cuff of this nice jacket they gave me.) Rituals and symbols can bond a team. We can more easily reason about things with a name.

Leadership is about relationships. Act with integrity so you build confidence and trust with the people who depend on you to deliver and the people who depend on you to lead the way

Every mistake, every disaster is an opportunity to learn, and to try something new.

You have a big vision, but it doesn’t happen all at once. Life is short. Celebrate the little wins.

I asked [Jez Humble](https://twitter.com/jezhumble) his definition of leadership, and one of the things he said was:

> You do something every day that will make life a little more awesome for the people around you.

Where do leaders come from?
---------------------------

Research indicates that leadership is not a heritable trait. Leadership emerges from a context that supports it. Leadership develops in a community of practice.

People need to see experienced leaders and have the opportunity to take a leadership role.

[Bridge Foundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/) is where I’ve most frequently witnessed leadership development. The organization which began as RailsBridge, with a project to teach Ruby on Rails to women. Bridge Foundry brings technical and leadership skills to people who have been marginalized. Everyone involved becomes better, and people have the chance to practice leadership in a safe and supportive environment. Experience leading and working within diverse teams leads to a more inclusive culture.

Communication and collaboration set the context
-----------------------------------------------

They come to a workshop to learn how to make a Rails app, but they also learn how to communicate about code and how to teach.

![Diverse group of people sitting on couches coding](http://madewithenvy.com/ecosystem/articles/2012/railsbridge-orlando-recap-july-27-28-2012/images/railsbridge-2.jpg)

They learn how to collaborate: women and men, people of different races and technical backgrounds work together. This should not be considered a rare sight in our society.  
You would think reading the popular press that these kinds of group don’t exist. For many of us, this a common experience. This kind of experience changes people.

Leadership is speaking up
-------------------------

Many years ago, when Sasha Laundy got her first engineering job, as a support engineer at Twillio, she told me this story. It was in her first few couple of months working there and she was eating lunch at a table with all male engineers. She mentioned that she had volunteered at a RailsBridge workshop over the weekend. One of the engineers asked what it was about. Fraught with fear about how these men would respond, she explained that RailsBridge offers free workshops teaching women Ruby on Rails. “Why?” one asked “isn’t that discrimination against men?” She took a deep breath, preparing to give a practiced, patient explanation about sexism, about the inherent bias of our society, and the lack of opportunity and safe environments for women. Instead one of her male colleagues held up his hand and said “we got this.” Sasha was freed up, to go back to her desk, and happily start coding again.

We need more men who recognize that sexism is bad for everyone and are willing to provide Feminism 101 lessons to their male colleagues. We need more white people who are willing to call out racism when we see it, just because it’s an awful way to treat other humans. We need to stop acting like we’re defending marginalized individuals, and start defending our working environment and expectations of each other.

### Real Software Development Culture

At RailsBridge workshops, we teach collaboratively. One or two teachers with TAs to help students debug and help answer tough questions. This experience models the collaborative software development process. Student think they are just learning syntax and coding patterns, but they are also being introduced to a software development culture. This kind of culture is not featured in TV shows or movies; you would not recognize it from reading the popular press; but it has been present in every job I’ve ever had and I see it in the most successful teams.

### The Cycle of Learning and Giving Back

I want to tell you about Nathan and Tim, founders of [CodePath](https://codepath.com/). Many years ago, they were working on a different startup, but after teaching at a RailsBridge workshop, they were inspired to start CodePath which provides free, accelerated mobile engineering classes for professional developers and designers. CodePath is funded exclusively through paid training seats reserved by top technology companies and by offering in house corporate training to select companies.

A couple of years ago, CodePath open sourced part of its curriculum and helped create MobileBridge. Now volunteers organize free weekend workshops in Android and iOS development.

Discussion / Q&amp;A
--------------------

Q: One killer skill for a developer?  
A: Know what you know, and what you don’t know. That way you can learn.

Learn how to compare things that are not exactly the same and judge if you can do it.

Some people are afraid of giving up power but if you make yourself replaceable you can spread knowledge and free yourself up.

If you don’t take risks, you won’t know your limits
