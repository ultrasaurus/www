<h1>learning through testing</h1>

<p>In my recent explorations of how to teach test-driven development (TDD), I have found a number of people writing about using testing for learning. First I read how Ross Niemi <a href="http://rossniemi.wordpress.com/2007/01/13/learning-ruby-tdd-style-part-1/">explored the assert method</a> by testing it. He talked about feeling that he would like to prove that he understood the syntax. Then I read how Mike Clark <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/03/18">developed his own test suite to teach himself Ruby</a>. He talks about how he “used the language as a tool to explore itself. In the same way that a test is better than a specification, the language is better than a description of the language. The test is definitive.”</p>
<p>Also, as a response to my last post about <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/08/test-driven-teaching/">test-driven teaching</a>, Seth Walker told me about <a href="http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans/tree/master">Ruby Koans</a>, which are a delightful test-driven meditation on Ruby syntax. I find them really fun and have been assigning them as homework in my class.</p>
<p>In my work, I often learn about my design or the implications of my implementation through testing. It is one of the things that is so invigorating about TDD. Discovering testing as a self-paced learning tool was simultaneously surprising and obvious.</p>
