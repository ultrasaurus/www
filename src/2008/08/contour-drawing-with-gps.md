Eric Nordenankar created the [biggest drawing in the world](http://biggestdrawingintheworld.com/drawing.aspx)  
(via [information aesthetics](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2008/05/biggest_drawing_in_the_world.html)): a GPS-generated self-portrait:

I like the elegance of the self-portrait and think it is amazing, even if simulated. I do hope Eric someday travels the path to make it real (or gets DHL to).

Another artist uses the same medium. Stavrosâ€™ art seen at [theworldismycanvas](http://www.theworldismycanvas.com) is more whimsical. I like this one:
