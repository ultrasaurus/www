<h1>evolving development style</h1>

<p><em>December 29, 2005</em></p>


<p>Over at the <a href="http://laszlomail.com/blog/">Laszlo Mail blog</a>, I’ve written about <a href="http://laszlomail.com/blog/2005/12/29/a-development-style-for-the-new-millenium/">a development style for the new millenium</a>. I’ve tried to bring what-has-worked in the past into the light of new requirements and opportunities. An appropriate year-end post, I reflect on our most recent release and how our development style reflects what we’ve learned over the year, as well as old software management lessons.</p>
<p>That article might have appeared here as easily as there. Unexpectedly, I find myself a contributing author to four blogs (and the sole author of two of them). I don’t think having more places to publish makes me write less in each, but rather creates more reason to write. <a href="http://www.flyingpaperclips.com">Flying Paperclips</a> is a simple notebook of science experiments. Some notes which might otherwise have been emails or checkin notes, now are published on the <a href="http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLaszlo weblog</a>.</p>
<p>With the Laszlo Mail blog, I’m experimenting with what has been called “the obligatory development blog” of web software. I grew up writing software in an atmosphere of secrecy, where one dare not discuss development methodologies for fear of violating NDAs and revealing trade secrets to a competitor. Nowadays companies are more comfortable being open about how software is developed, or perhaps there was no danger before and my fear caused unnecessary self-censorship. In any case, I appreciate the developers who have created a well-trodden path, as I venture into this unexplored territory in my personal landscape. I’m still unsure what is a daring revelation vs. a mundane, even uninteresting detail of private software development. Every new release brings fresh challenges as well as familiar obstacles. I enjoy reading how other people go about this act of creatng and publishing software. It is fun to add my stories to the mix.</p>
