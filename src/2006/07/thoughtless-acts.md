How does our environment influence our behavior? This [lovely book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0811847756&tag=ultrasaurus-20&camp=1789&creative=9325), by Jane Fulton Suri + IDEO, highlights things we do as we interact with the objects in our world and with other people. It challenges us to consider: which of these acts are conscious and which are done without thought? How do we react, respond, co-opt, and confom to our world? How do we create signals to other people about what belongs and what should happen?

Some of my favorites:

*“reacting? …we interact automatically  
 with objects and spaces that we encounter”*

*“co-opting? …we make use of opportunities  
 present in our immediate surroundings”*

*“adapting? …we alter the purpose or context of things  
 to meet our objectives”*

*“conforming? ..we learn patterns of behavior from others  
in our social and cultural group”*

If the book isn’t enough, or if you want to participate, there’s also a [Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/thoughtlessacts/pool/) on the topic. Here are some highlights:

“<font size="+1">Problems worth solving…</font> It’s a mistake to interpret observations too literally, though: the world doesn’t need a uniquq design solution for every creative adaptationwe see (that’s the kind of stuff that ends up advertised in in-flight catalogs!)”

The book has a very nice [web site](http://www.thoughtlessacts.com/), which cycles through a selection of photos from the book when you click on different sections; however, you the object itself is really very wonderful. You should [buy it](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0811847756&tag=ultrasaurus-20&camp=1789&creative=9325) or ask me to show it to you the next time you see me :)
