There’s a nice [zdnet article](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Stewart/?p=25) about [cooqy](http://www.cooqy.com), an eBay site developed using [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org) by Robert Yeager . “After taking a look at AJAX, Flash and traditional web development platforms, he settled on OpenLazslo. According to him it was because it was a mature product as well as free and open source. OpenLaszlo’s elegant XML-based programming model was a big plus and made for rapid development. Cooqy went from nothing to core functionality in 4 weeks of part time work.”
