I just went through a [fabulous tutorial](http://darynholmes.wordpress.com/2008/03/15/beginners-tutorial-routing-in-rails-20-with-rest-part-1-of-n/) by Daryn Holmes about routes. It is written for 2.0.2, but I found that nothing had changed for 2.2. I already had a good feel for how routes worked, but stepping through the details was very helpful.

Key points:

- By default controllers render the view that has the same name of the action invoked.
- index is the default action

**Debugging Tips:**  
You can quickly see where a route ends up by typing this into irb:

```

>> rts = ActionController::Routing::Routes
>> rts.recognize_path("/")
=> {:controller=>"albums", :action=>"index"}
```

You can also go in the reverse direction to see what URL would be generated by a route. To see what URL an action will end up at:

```

>> rts.generate(:controller=>'albums',:action=>'index')
=> "/music"
```
