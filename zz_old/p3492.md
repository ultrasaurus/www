As I work on preparing the year-end books for Blazing Cloud, it feels like accounting is like programming, except it make me feel like a software compiler. Then I thought that perhaps my bookkeeper is the compiler or perhaps the IRS. As the business owner, I act like a QA engineer… looking at forecasts for January through March. Our budget is a test plan for validating that if I sign this contract and everyone puts in enough billable hours then there’ll be cash for payroll with enough left over for unexpected disasters, fun or profilt.
