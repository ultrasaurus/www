In the past month we took some first steps to inviting women into the SF Ruby community:

1. [First Workshop](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10377288/) was well attended with tremendous [community support](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/06/open-source-workshop/)
2. [Hack session](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10685547/) (sponsored by [Orange](http://www.francetelecom.com/) and [Sustainable Websites](http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/)) where many of the workshop attendees continued their learning; and women and men from the community brought their own projects to work on.

Now we need to keep up the momentum and generate a few more peers for the women who are continuing to develop in Ruby. To that end, we have scheduled [another workshop](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10804417/), July 31-August 1 with the generous support of [Pivotal Labs](http://www.pivotallabs.com/) and [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com/). In order to make this workshop as successful as the last one, we need your help:

- Please sign up to volunteer on [Friday](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10826791/) and/or [Saturday](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10827608/): 
  - if you are a developer who has experience with Ruby on Rails and are willing to answer questions and offer debugging assistance during the workshop
  - if you attended the last workshop, you will learn a lot from being a TA!
  - if you just want to help, we need folks for registration and other logistics
- Sponsors 
  - we haven’t yet planned an “after party” but it would be great to do that again
  - do you have some cool stuff you want to bestow upon our attendees, good books? special deals? let’s make these new folks feel welcome
- Locations for follow-up events: do you have space you would be willing to share on a weekend or evening? 
  - post-workshop hack session: informal workspace or conference room
  - advanced workshop: two conference rooms would be ideal
  - September workshop: large meeting room with a number of smaller conference rooms
