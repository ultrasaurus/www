<h1>people love Ruby&amp;#8230; is that appropriate?</h1>

<p>People love Ruby… “is that appropriate?” Dave Thomas asks, “is a software tool something that should be the object of our love?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“programmers, like poets, constantly start with a blank piece of paper… so we have to love our tools, since otherwise we grow frustrated and that ends up showing in our work.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed <span class="caption"><a href="http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/keynote.html">Dave Thomas’ RubyConf 2008 keynote</a> in which he challenged the Ruby enthusiasts in the audience to f**k Ruby (get your mind out of the gutter, he meant *fork*) to show love for the language. Perhaps this talk was the genesis of “<a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/05/fork-is-the-new-friend/">fork is the new friend</a>” or perhaps that idea is new for me but well known for community.</span></p>
<p>Dave’s talk sheds light on delightful corners of the Ruby Language and is worth checking out. I’m increasingly enamored of open source tools that I use in my daily work and find that spending a little time now and then to contribute a patch or edit a wiki will streamline my later work and brings a joy akin to gardening.</p>
