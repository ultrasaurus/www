It helps me to create little rules that provide default decisions for common and unusual situations. A couple of years ago, I wrote down my [little rules for working life](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/2013/09/little-rules-for-working-life/). Since then, I’ve collected a few more…

Communication
-------------

- Speak the unspoken.
- Have difficult conversations.
- Find something remarkable, and remark on it, every day.
- Not everything needs to be said.

Decision-Making
---------------

- **Be intentional**: for me, it takes reflection and constant conscious effort for my words and actions to reflect my values.
- **Consider your influencers** (the people who influence you), and choose them as intentionally as you can.
- **Have a plan.** Learn something. **Change the plan.**
- **Play the long game.** Sometimes we have to do stuff that we don’t care about in the short-term, in order to meet expectations from people who decide if we get paid or if we get privileges. Even while we do the stupid short-term things, we can sometimes set ourselves up for some potentially awesome, or at least potentially meaningful future.
- **Focus on the outcome.** Imagine what happens after you reach your goal. Then what? Often the real goal is the next thing, or the thing after that.

Getting Unstuck
---------------

- When you hit a wall, **step back and learn.** Learn more about the problem. Who else sees it as a problem? Who made this wall anyhow? It’s probably there for a reason and the problem might be an unintended consequence.
- **Get to know the people.** The system is made of people, and usually those aren’t the same people who made the system.
- **Write stuff down.** Sometimes what you think you heard wasn’t the same thing other people heard.
- **Wait a week and ask again.** Or a month. Or just listen for the moment when someone else raises the same problem, and chime in.
