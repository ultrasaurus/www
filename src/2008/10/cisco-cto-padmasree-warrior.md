“I aim to change the myth around what is a geek and what isn’t.

“I think to me a geek is someone who is passionate about technology, who really cares about innovation and how to drive innovation and refine society,” she said. “That’s how I define myself as a geek.”

I really like to hear about people self-identifying as a geek in a positive way. Folks need to be more exposed to people like Padma Warrior to understand why they should consider diving into a technical career.
