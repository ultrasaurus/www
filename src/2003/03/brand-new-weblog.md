It was much easier installing moveabletype into this media temple account than it was getting it up and running on my Windows machine at home. I always like to have a local version of software to play with and it has been fun (in a geeky sort of way) getting to know the archane rites of MySql, perl, Apache, and whatnot.

Many thanks to  
– the people of the opensource movement who wrote all this software  
– Ric, who I don’t know, but who wrote a great [tutorial ](http://www.ricocheting.com/server/)for setting up a windows server  
– [media temple ](http://www.mediatemple.net)for making it even easier than that  
– and lastly, [Kevin Lynch](http://www.klynch.com), who is always an inspiration, but specifically, in this instance, pointed me toward Moveable Type and, perhaps unknowingly, inspired me to create my own blog.
