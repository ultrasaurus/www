We recently wrapped up version 2.0 of the Laszlo Presentation Server. In celebration of the new components, I opened a couple of [Cafe Press](http://www.cafepress.com/) stores to special-order some custom Laszlo schwag. It was a fun excuse to check out Cafe Press. Its an amazing business where you can create your own T-shirts, mugs or whatever with custom graphics. The site is very easy to use and I highly recommend it.

So… the stores are open and mugs are sold at cost. I’m posting links here for Laszlovians, Laszlo developers and other fans.

Art and words by Peter Andrea. I’m not sure that he inteded the words to be immortalized in ceramic. Created originally in a test file, we enjoyed them so much that they travelled into an example file.

Mug graphic preparations by Dan Lewis. Tabs by Christian Walker and Pablo Kang. Checkbox and radio buttons by me. Font by [Truth in Design](http://www.truthindesign.com/) with insane amounts of detail work by Chris Lowrey and Peter Andrea.
