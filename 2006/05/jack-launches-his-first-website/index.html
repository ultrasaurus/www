<h1>Jack launches his first website</h1>

<p>Last week, my 8-year-old son, Jack, launched his first website (with a little technical help from mom). He has recently started reading chapter books, and I suggested that he could write up his thoughts about each book and publish them on the web. He was really into the idea and even thought up the domain name: <a href="http://www.bookula.com">bookula.com</a>. (Many thanks to Ryan Afdahl at <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net">Media Temple</a> for helping set up the new domain.)</p>
<p>Jack wrote all the text, and plans to add a new book review every week. I set up links to Amazon, using my Amazon associates account, but Iâ€™ve promised that all the proceeds will go directly to him to buy whatever book he wants (or maybe some legos). Check it out!</p>
