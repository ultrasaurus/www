Nice reflections from the Dalai Lama, which were forwarded to me via email from my cousin, and with the nature of such email messages, I have no idea who made the slide show. At the turn of the year, I find it nice to look back while looking forward and I enjoyed these gentle reminders…

> Take into account that great love and great achievements involve great risk.
> 
> Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.
> 
> Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.

Best viewed full screen, here’s the slide show on slideshare:
