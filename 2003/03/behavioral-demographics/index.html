<h1>behavioral demographics</h1>

<p>I was intrigued by the discussions of Microsoft’s new <a href="http://www.threedegrees.com">3°</a> project,<br>
and in particular by Michael Gartenberg’s <a href="http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/gartenberg/archives/000264.html">observation</a> that this software targets &quot;a behavioral demographic not just an age demographic.&quot;</p>
<p>I never thought of it that way. I used to think that if we create compelling<br>
experiences for people on the internet — virtual places that give back more<br>
than people put into them, then this real-time online stuff would finally prove<br>
useful to the general population. Over time I’ve recognized that a lot of change<br>
needs to happen before any sufficiently new technology catches on. Email was<br>
around for decades, but it was the web which drove most people to<br>
hook up their PCs to the Internet.</p>
<p>Instant Messaging has emerged as the killer<br>
app in this category of connected applications. The buddy list and its expression<br>
of presence<br>
fundamentally changed the nature<br>
of chat. I find it interesting to think in terms of a behavioral demographic.<br>
If you don’t spend much of your time sitting in front of a connected<br>
PC, then Instant Messaging certainly loses its appeal.</p>
<p>[Update: the end of this post seems to have been lost in the mists of time, along with my observation that the icons looked like little ducks, which provides a little context for Sam’s comment]</p>
