“Hallelujah!” It sure feels good to hear someone acknowledge that [usability is a technical problem](http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/07/07/1640244).

For a while I’ve been reflecting upon the lack of good user interface design in open source systems. Of course, I more freqently reflect upon the lack of good user interface design in general. Good UI is hard, but as Frans Englich points out the open source approach has licked a number of hard problems. Security is hard too.

I believe that good design is all about making choices and applying a bit of common sense. We need to take the time to really think about the decisions that we ask people to make when they use our software.

I enjoyed [Joel Spolsky’s observation](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html) that the Options dialog is an archaeological record for software development. “It is the height of arrogance for a software designer to inflict a choice … on the user simply because the designer couldn’t think hard enough to decide which option is really better.”

Havoc Pennington also discusses [the question of preferences](http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html). “For any program, there are literally an infinite number of possible preferences. Each one has a cost. … the UI developer’s job is to choose the useful subset of possible preferences.”

I don’t know why every software engineer doesn’t care about the human experience. If people don’t use the software we write what’s the point?
