<h1>Laszlo is XML tech&amp;#8230;</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.davidtemkin.com">Daivd Temkin</a>, CTO of Laszlo Systems, puts Laszlo in context following the Macromedia Flex announcement. He writes that Laszlo is XML technology, not Flash technology:</p>
<p>“We think the Web is on the verge of a sea change, with the dual drivers of broadband and Web services, and we see an XML-based framework for RIAs as essential to this transition.” (<a href="http://www.davidtemkin.com/mtarchive/000001.html">read more</a>)</p>
<p>Laszlo’s XML language and framework are a powerful way to create next generation web applications. SWF is a convenient output format, but Laszlo Presentation Server offers significant benefits over raw Flash. In fact, it offers significant benefits over any other method of developing an application user interface.</p>
