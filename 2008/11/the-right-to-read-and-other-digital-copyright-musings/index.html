<h1>the &amp;#8220;right to read&amp;#8221; and other digital copyright musings</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">The Right to Read</a> by Richard Stallman is an insightful scifi piece that is grounded in local laws and policies that have already been enacted or proposed.</p>
<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/11/19/the-future-of-reading">The Future of Reading (A Play in Six Acts)</a> (via Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=1023&amp;tag=btxcsim">The Cult of Kindle</a>), which references Stallman’s essay, is another reflection on the same topic — poetic and thoughtful.</p>
<p>I was already convinced that DRM is a crazy notion, but I found it interesting the read about its disturbing manifestations in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070812-google-selleth-then-taketh-away-proving-the-need-for-drm-circumvention.html">Google selleth then taketh away, proving the need for DRM circumvention</a>) which references the arcane legal review system that determined that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061124-8280.html">cell phone unlocking</a> is an exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (and therefore legal), but playing DVDs on Linux and distributing audiobooks from libraries are not exempt and therefore illegal. Go figure.</p>
<p>Squint your eyes a bit and you can see a brave new world.</p>
