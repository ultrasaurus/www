<h1>civic love</h1>

<p><em>March 23, 2015</em></p>


<p>On Friday, I went to the monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Civic-Love-Shaping-a-Responsible-Future-for-the-Bay-Area/events/221071284/?comment_table_id=446406409&amp;comment_table_name=event_comment">civic love</a> meetup in San Francisco. It was held in the beautiful Friends of Boeddeker Park facility next to kids playing in the newly renovated park and playground.</p>
<p>I must admit it would not have occurred to me to wonder what happened to the people who used to frequent this park. Someone had remarked at how nice it was to see all of the kids playing in the park. One of the <a href="http://www.faithfulfools.org/">Faithful Fools</a>, a Tenderloin non-profit, said he remembered this place as kind of a living room for adults — the neighborhood is mostly Single Room Occupancy (SRO) apartments, and people would come to the park and do the things that other people get to do in their living rooms. He wondered, where is that happening now? Those people have been displaced. Of course this safe, kid-friendly space is wonderful, but it displace a different sort of community center.</p>
<p>Wow, this stuff is complicated.</p>
<p>Sam Dennison, chief financial officer for Faithful Fools, mentioned that he was on KQED’s forum: <a href="http://www.kqed.org/a/forum/R201503101000">Are Tenderloin Tech Firms Being Good Neighbors?</a> The representatives from the tech companies seem earnest and a few employees are getting actively involved, but after hearing from homeless activists and a longtime tenderloin resident, I can see how far apart these worlds are.</p>
<p>On the KQED show, Zendesk mentioned that at their current size, they could sustain one employee volunteering once per week, but with 500 employees, that would mean that just 10% volunteer once per year (if I’m doing the math right). It seems like they could give <em>everyone</em> more than one day per year. Nonetheless, I liked how Tiffany Apczynski, director of social responsibility and public affairs for Zendesk, presented their community involvement. It was good to hear about Twitter’s plans too, since I hadn’t heard anything since they first moved in. They are planning to build a $6M center across the street from Twitter where employees can volunteer. I admit that I love Twitter as a service, but have yet to see the positive community impact that I think they could have. Again they face that tough challenge to cross the culture chasm between Twitter engineer and long-time Tenderloin resident.</p>

<p>I talked about my dream of bringing RailsBridge workshops to people who desperately need jobs. I don’t think everyone wants to be a software developer, but I do believe there are quite a few people on the streets who would be brilliant coders. I’d like to find them. <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelleGlauser">MichelleGlauser</a> is way ahead of me on that idea, but it was inspiring to hear about some places that are teaching computer skills:<br>
