<h1>HyperScope release</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.hyperscope.org">HyperScope </a>, a modern Ajax-ified version of Doug Engelbart’s Augment System, is released as open source (under GPL) in its initial version. There’s a <a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augmentinghumanintellect.opml">demo</a> of the system which presents some of Doug Engelbart’s writing and is a good way to get to know the goals of the system. There is a <a href="http://blueoxen.net/c/hyperscope/blog/archives/23">lauch party</a> tonight.</p>

from <a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augmentinghumanintellect.opml">AUGMENTING HUMAN INTELLECT: A Conceptual Framework</a>. (direct link to quote <a href="http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augmentinghumanintellect.opml#1A2">1a2</a>)<br>
By Douglas C. Engelbart.</p>
<p>It is so exciting to see this technology which was ground-breaking (and fully functioning!) in the 1960s brought forward as an open source project. Congratulations to <a href="http://hyperscope.org/community/index.html">everyone</a> who made it happen.</p>
