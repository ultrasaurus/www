I’m not much of a gamer. I prefer to find delight in creative projects that feel like play. It might be some remnant puritanical work ethic from my New England roots, or perhaps its just that most games aren’t well-suited to my demographic. Nonetheless, I’m intrigued by game design and find that some aspects of game design can be applied generally to software design, as well.

I read today a [nice discussion](http://lostgarden.com/2008/06/what-actitivies-that-can-be-turned-into.html) of [Wii Fit](http://www.nintendo.com/wiifit). Shigeru Miyamoto, famed Nintendo game designer who created Super Mario and the Wii, is known for designing for the expression on someone’s face when they play the game — they should smile and be happy, not frustrated. With the Wii, he designs for everyone in the room, not just the game player. I like the idea of using the Wii for fun fitness training. Taking game elements and applying them to boring or otherwise frustrating activities has potential.
