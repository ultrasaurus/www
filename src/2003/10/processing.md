I’ve enjoyed experimenting with the “alpha” relase of [processing](http://www.proce55ing.net) (via [Sam Wan](http://63.144.246.231/information/archives/000165.html)). It’s a fun new programming environment which is good at creating freeform animations and playing with colors in space. (There are examplefs of sound and camera input in the [exhibition area](http://proce55ing.net/software/index.pl), but I haven’t gotten that far myself.)

Here are two interactive pieces that I made. It was fun to remember trignometry. It has been a long time since I wrote code to animate a simple bounce. Processing let me focus on the core of the pattern without worrying about the mundane details (at least until I had to draw a button). This will be a great teachnig language, and it is quite impressive for an early release.
