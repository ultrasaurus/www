<h1>next steps for ruby gender balance</h1>

<p><em>July 08, 2009</em></p>


<p>In the past month we took some first steps to inviting women into the SF Ruby community:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10377288/">First Workshop</a> was well attended with tremendous <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/06/open-source-workshop/">community support</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10685547/">Hack session</a> (sponsored by <a href="http://www.francetelecom.com/">Orange</a> and <a href="http://www.sustainablewebsites.com/">Sustainable Websites</a>) where many of the workshop attendees continued their learning; and women and men from the community brought their own projects to work on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we need to keep up the momentum and generate a few more peers for the women who are continuing to develop in Ruby. To that end, we have scheduled <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10804417/">another workshop</a>, July 31-August 1 with the generous support of <a href="http://www.pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs</a> and <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">EngineYard</a>. In order to make this workshop as successful as the last one, we need your help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please sign up to volunteer on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10826791/">Friday</a> and/or <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10827608/">Saturday</a>:
<ul>
<li>if you are a developer who has experience with Ruby on Rails and are willing to answer questions and offer debugging assistance during the workshop</li>
<li>if you attended the last workshop, you will learn a lot from being a TA!</li>
<li>if you just want to help, we need folks for registration and other logistics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sponsors
<ul>
<li>we haven’t yet planned an “after party” but it would be great to do that again</li>
<li>do you have some cool stuff you want to bestow upon our attendees, good books? special deals? let’s make these new folks feel welcome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Locations for follow-up events: do you have space you would be willing to share on a weekend or evening?
<ul>
<li>post-workshop hack session: informal workspace or conference room</li>
<li>advanced workshop: two conference rooms would be ideal</li>
<li>September workshop: large meeting room with a number of smaller conference rooms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get involved, please join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/railsbridge-workshops">google group</a>.<br>
