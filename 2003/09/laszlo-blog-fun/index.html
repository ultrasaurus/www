<h1>Laszlo blog fun</h1>

<p>At <a href="http://drdreff.blogspot.com/2003_09_07_drdreff_archive.html#106305830618139273">Mark’s Hole in the Web</a>, you can check out a neat little toy he made for his blog gutter. It shows a hierarchical list of links in a small space, using animation and interactivity. I really like the colorization — you can see it with two different background colors in the gutter and the content of the blog.</p>
<p>Mark notes that it was quick to write, “weighing in at 120 lines of code.” The links are given using embed/object tag parameters. It would be neat if this read OPML files, and it would probably take even less code.</p>
