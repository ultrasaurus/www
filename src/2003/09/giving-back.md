Before I considered writing a blog of my own, I found myself enjoying other people’s blogs. I found information that I wouldn’t have otherwise read. In the haze of internet commercialization, it seems odd to talk about giving back to the community, but this altruistic inclination was the #3 reason that I started this blog.

The internet has a wonderful history of people freely sharing their creations. As a backdrop to the venture-capital-driven internet boom, there were always organizations and individuals who contributed to shared community wisdom and practical software. From [slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) to [ask-a-linguist](http://www.linguistlist.org/~ask-ling/), there are large and small communities that exists purely to provide information to like-minded souls.
