<h1>rubyconf hallway track</h1>

<p><em>2009-11-28</em></p> 


<p>RubyConf had a most excellent “hallway track.” This was augmented by the fabulous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poken">Poken</a>, which allowed you to “high-four” someone who you met and avoid rummaging around for business cards. It also let you look up someone’s name who you ought to know, but had forgotten.</p>
<p>This was the first time I attended RubyConf. I have been programming in Ruby for almost a year and through organizing <a href="http://sfrubyworkshops.com/">outreach workshops</a> and other <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> activities, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/">SF Ruby</a>, and adventures in the twitterverse and blogosphere, I knew (and knew of) quite a few Rubyists.</p>
<p>The best part of RubyConf was meeting people who I had previously known only virtually — from people whose blogs or books I had read, to people whose software I had worked with, to those with whom I have had ephemeral conversations with via twitter or fleeting working relationships via RailsBridge. I found people to be very friendly and outgoing. More so than at any other conference I have attended, people would just start talking to me in the hallway and I found it easy to join people for lunch or beers. I’m sure it helped to be a speaker, but I have been a speaker at other conferences and been well-known in other communities which didn’t have the same feeling of being welcomed as a new friend.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>I was impressed by Jim Meier who rounded up a group of folks who didn’t all know each other for Thursday dinner at Steelhead Brewery. I got to meet <a href="http://twitter.com/paul_brannan">Paul Brannan</a>, a long-time Rubyist who is one of four people to have attended every RubyConf. Sadly, for the other folks I met that evening, my poken failed me. I got an awesome introduction to Erlang from a new friend, whose name I can’t place and whose vcard was not recorded in my poken.</p>
<p>Lunch with <a href="http://twitter.com/averyj">James Avery</a>, Nathanial Talbot of <a href="http://terralien.com/">Terralien</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/jimweirich">Jim Weirich</a>, creator of xmlbuilder and rake, who warmly participated in my Ruby word game: a good use of the word “closure” in a sentence and related challenges. Jim came up with: “Objects may be used to implement closures; and closures may be used to implement objects.” This not only led to intriguing lunchtime conversation, but also to fun <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/media/e426e144-80bc-4394-837c-b5461da4bb82">Japanese translation</a> (more on that later, after all of the phrases are posted!).</p>
<p>Caleb Clausen spontaneously invited me to a recap of his presentation, <a href="http://rubyconf.org/talks/84-towards-a-ruby-compiler">Toward a Ruby Compiler</a>, which he was giving to Laurent (of MacRuby) during a break.</p>
<p>I had some nice real-time conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/webandy">Andy Atkinson</a> who I has previously only known thru twitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/">David Chilimnsky</a> of RSpec fame, whose book I have enjoyed, had been following my adventures in test-first-teaching with RSpec. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised but the internet is a funny place where you never know who is really reading the bits of information that you send off into the ether.</p>
<p>I closed the conference by attending <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=larkconf">larkconf</a>, where <a href="http://twitter.com/l4rk">l4rk</a> asked people who joined the circle of beer-drinkers to share their dream. That little kumbaya moment had the unexpected effect of making it just a tiny bit less awkward to be the only woman approaching a crowd of a dozen or so guys at a bar. I talking with <a href="http://twitter.com/briandoll">Brian Doll</a> about the SFRuby community and <a href="http://twitter.com/bonkydog">Brian Jenkins</a> about interactive fiction and <a href="http://twitter.com/imf">Ian McFarland</a> about language.</p>
<p>Overall the conference for me was characterized by informal conversation with famous, lesser known and novice Rubyists. It was kind of sad that more folks could not attend, but I really enjoyed the small scale of the gathering.</p>
