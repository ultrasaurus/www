“The capacity of digital data storage worldwide has doubled every nine months for at least a decade, at twice the rate predicted by Moore’s Law for the growth of computing power during the same period \[5\]. This less familiar but  
noteworthy phenomenon, which we call Storage Law, is among the reasons for the increasing importance and rapid growth of the field of data mining. The aggressive rate of growth of disk storage and the gap between Moore’s Law and Storage Law growth trends represents a very interesting pattern in the state of technology evolution. <font size="+1">Our ability to capture and store data has far outpaced our ability to process and utilize it.</font>”
