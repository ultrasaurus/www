<h1>sudden spike in evolution?</h1>

<p>“In fact, female performance in high school mathematics now matches that of males. If biology were the basis of that, we’ve seen some major evolution in the past decades.”</p>
<p>According to a recent “<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14893782/">study</a>,” women are being overlooked or actively ignored for promotion and the committee could find no reason for the discrepancy in gender representation. This committee of experts ruled out “biological differences in ability, hormonal influences, childrearing demands, and even differences in ambition.”</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
