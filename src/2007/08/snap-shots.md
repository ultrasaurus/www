I just added “snap shots” from [Snap.com](http://www.snap.com) to this site (first seen on [truemors](http://truemors.com/)). I’m not really sure whether it is awesome or distracting.

I just added a line of javascript to the top of this page and it adds visual previews for [links](http://www.snap.com), interactive excerpts of [Wikipedia articles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso), [MySpace profiles](http://www.myspace.com/askaninja), [IMDb profiles](http://imdb.com/name/nm0424060) and [Amazon products](http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-N95-Silver-Phone-Unlocked/dp/B000PEOLAG/), display inline [videos](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7rEM_dN24S0), [RSS](http://www.slashdot.org/), [MP3s](http://wiredset.com/media/colin_macintyre/How-Bout-I-Love-You-More.mp3), [photos](http://i116.photobucket.com/albums/o34/perspexspaceship/), and [stock charts](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aapl).

The idea is to bring you the information you need, without your having to leave the site, while other times it lets you “look ahead,” before deciding if you want to follow a link or not.

If you decide you don’t like it, just click the Options icon in the upper right corner of the Snap Shot and opt-out. In any case, do let me know what you think.
