<h1>Laszlo preview release</h1>

<p>A preview release of <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/">Laszlo Presentation Server version 2.0</a> is now available. Woo hoo!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Component Framework</strong>: All the components you expect in a web app plus a few more. This framework is fully laszlo-rrific — with the details you know and love from an OS GUI with all the cinematic user experience you’ve come to expect from a Laszlo app. The components support simple declaration, data binding, full scripting APIs, and keyboard navigation — whew!</li>
<li><strong>KRANK Optimizer</strong>: Every web engineer worries about performance. Here’s something for the Laszlo bag o’ tricks. This new “instant-on” technology allows developers to optimize an application so that it will start immediately once downloaded.</li>
<li><strong>Live examples</strong> in the Documentation: I use this feature all the time. With a single click you can modify and recompile examples.</li>
<li><strong>Better and cooler data binding</strong>: if you liked data binding and replication from v1, you’re gonna love the new $path expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>The components were my main gig on this release, jamming with Bret Simister, Peter Andrea, and the gang. I think this may be the first component set created entirely in declarative XML. The complete source code for the components is included with the developer edition. You can check out a <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/lps/examples/components/style_example.lzo">component example</a> which you change the style to see the components in different colors. The components use a new “Ultra Pixel” font created especially for Laszlo by <a href="http://www.truthindesign.com">Truth in Design</a>.</p>
