<h1>why are scrollbars on the right?</h1>

<p>Did you ever wonder why we put scrollbars on the right? I always thought that they just feel better there because they are a fairly heavy-weight UI component and it makes sense for them to live in a fallow area.</p>
<p>“The Gutenberg Rule, first proposed by typographer Edmund Arnold in the early 1950s, says there are four quadrants on a page: the Primary Optical Area (POA; top left), the Terminal Area (TA; bottom right), the Strong Fallow Area (SFA; top right), and the Weak Fallow Area (WFA; bottom left). The theory says that the eye enters a page in the POA and moves by the most direct route to the TA, via what Arnold calls <em>reading gravity</em>.” — from a <a href="http://arts.deakin.edu.au/alj317/topic10_11.htm">Deakin University</a> class</p>
<p><a href="http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/users/dixa/papers/scrollbar/">Alan Dix’s article</a> tells a different story. He provides a historical perspective describing systems that positioned scrollbars on the left, and introduces some interesting theories that support the modern convention.</p>
