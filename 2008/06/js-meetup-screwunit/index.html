<h1>js meetup: ScrewUnit</h1>

<p>Nick demonstrated ScrewUnit at the <a href="http://javascript.meetup.com/4/calendar/7922755/?a=cr1p_grp">JSMeetup</a> last night. My notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>behavior-driven development, particularly popular in the Ruby world with the RSPEC framework</li>
<li>organize your tests, share setup</li>
<li>global befores and afters let you effectively test the DOM</li>
<li>nested describes, nested example groups in RSPEC</li>
</ul>
<p>What about continuous integration? there’s a ScrewUnit server, navigate URLs – only run those in that directory. There are callbacks when a suite ends/begins — integrated into CruiseControl</p>
<p>on GIT hub, MIT license</p>
<p>support for async libs? unsolved problems, most people at the company stub out async.</p>
<p>What about user interactions? serious attention on event and DOM testing. Nothing in particular to facilitate that except before and after. JQuery is a good approach…</p>
