“Information foraging theory…views humans as informavores, continually seeking information from our environment”  
— Do Your Links Stink? [Techniques for Good Web Information Scent](http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Jun-02/withrow.html) by Jason Withrow

I enjoy foraging for information, but I imagine that someday I’ll be able to unleash virtual hounds who will go dig up information with just the right scent. It would be neat if there were some quasi-intelligent software that could read what I write and lurk as I browse the web and then dig up interesting reading for me.

Jason Withrow talks about information scent and other ideas from cognitive psychology, such as perception, memory and learning, in his [boxes and arrows article](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/cognitive_psychology_ia_from_theory_to_practice.php).
