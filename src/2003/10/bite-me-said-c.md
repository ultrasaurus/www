Burning Bird writes [the Parable of the Languages](http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/000581.htm). She has quite accurately captured a conversation that could happen if only programming languages could talk.

Interesting to note several comments after the story by programming languages who missed (or weren’t invited to) the party.
