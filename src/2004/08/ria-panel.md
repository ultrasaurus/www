Bay CHI is putting on a very interesting panel this week: [Reading the Technology Tea Leaves: Is a Rich Internet Application in Your Future?](http://www.baychi.org/program/)

The panel will feature speakers representing a range of RIA tech: Laszlo (of course), Macromedia (who coined the term “RIA”) and a couple of DHTML wizards from Oddpost.

I expect it to be an interesting evening — don’t miss it!
