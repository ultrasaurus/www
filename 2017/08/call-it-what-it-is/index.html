<h1>call it what it is</h1>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/13/us/charlottesville-white-nationalist-rally-car-crash/index.html">news from Charlottesville</a> is not an isolated incident. The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/12/politics/trump-charlottesville-statement/index.html">US President responds</a> that there is violence “on many sides.” <em>This is false.</em></p>
<p>In Charlottesville, the police were present in riot gear, but the rioting white people were treated with kid gloves, a stark difference from <a href="https://twitter.com/JayDowTV/status/896813698047758336">Fergusen police reaction</a> reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/JayDowTV">@JayDowTV</a> who was there.</p>
<p>These people feel comfortable <a href="https://www.dailystormer.com/unitetheright-charlottesville-live-updates/">declaring it a war</a>: “And to everyone, know this: we are now at war. And we are not going to back down. There will be more events. Soon. We are going to start doing this nonstop. Across the country. I’m going to arrange them myself. Others will too, I’m sure, but I’m telling you now: I am going to start arranging my own events. We are going to go bigger than Charlottesville. We are going to go huge.”</p>
<p>General McMaster, US National Security Advisor tells us “I think what terrorism is, is the use of violence to incite terror and fear. And, of course, it was terrorism” (NBC via <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/8/13/16140490/terrorism-chuck-todd-mcmaster-charlottesville-racism-violence">Vox</a>)</p>
<p>A Christian minister writes this plainly on his post, <a href="http://johnpavlovitz.com/2017/08/12/yes-this-is-racism/">Yes, This is Racism</a>. We each need to declare what we stand for in this moment and always.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are not with you, torch-bearers, in Charlottesville or anywhere.<br>
We do not consent to this.<br>
In fact we stand against you, alongside the very beautiful diversity that you fear.<br>
We stand with people of every color and of all faiths, people of every orientation, nationality, and native tongue.</p>
<p>We are not going to have this. This is not the country we’ve built together and it will not become what you intend it to become.</p>
<p>So you can kiss our diverse, unified, multi-colored behinds because your racism and your terrorism will not win the day.</p>
<p>Believe it.</p>
<p>— John Pavlovitz</p>
