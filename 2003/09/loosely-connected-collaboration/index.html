<h1>loosely connected collaboration</h1>

<p>For the last few weeks I’ve been participating in a project that involves multiple people, yet has no meetings, no rules and is a great deal of fun. The process is facilitated by real world conversation and e-mail, but it wouldn’t be so practical and so easy without blogs.</p>
<p>It all started back in July – August when <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/">Marc Canter</a> suggested that Laszlo build something that bloggers could use, and <a href="http://www.osteele.com">Oliver Steele</a> prototyped a <a href="http://www.mylaszlo.com/lps/ows/lbw/lbw.lzx">laszlo blogging widget</a>. Although Marc <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/08/08.html#a1600">talked about the project</a> on his blog and we had a few meetings about it at the office, I didn’t have a lot of time to dive in and build it. So we talked and I waited for the time that the project would appear in my schedule or get handed off to someone else.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mark Davis was working on something completely different for his blog. A <a href="http://drdreff.blogspot.com/2003_09_07_drdreff_archive.html#106305830618139273">nav toy</a> that could be paramterized to display a list of links. The project included one hand-painted gradient png and about a hundred lines of LZX code. Dan Lewis spotted it and handily provided some new gradients and a “powered by Laszlo” footer.</p>
<p>I thought it was neat and and <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000072.html">wrote about it</a>. Then I noticed an opportunity. I saw a small improvement that would cause me to want to put it on my blog (adding an XML config file). I set out to make that one change, then got excited and added a few others. Later that night I had morphed it into an <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000074.html">OPML viewer</a>. Since I was coding quickly I took out all the parameterization and hard-coded the colors.</p>
<p>Marc Canter sees it and e-mails me: “I want one of those – NOW! I can’t wait. What do I have to do?” Lyndon Wong tells me that he wants one too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mark Davis has adopted <a href="http://drdreff.blogspot.com/2003_09_07_drdreff_archive.html#106313611341290309">a few changes</a> but wants to keep his HTML parameterization and extolls its virtues in a hallway conversation. I realize that it would be cool to let the other folks pick their own colors, so I go ahead and put that back in.</p>
<p>So Canter puts my OPML viewer on <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/">his page</a>, and Lyndon puts Mark Davis’s nav toy on <a href="http://lyndonwong.blogspot.com/">his page</a>. Now <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/09/16.html">Marc has ideas</a> of how to glue it into <a href="http://topicexchange.com/">Topic Exchange</a> and the <a href="http://www.peopleaggregator.com/">PeopleAggregator</a>.</p>
<p>Its latest incarnation was inspired by David Temkin’s suggestion that we should put a “view source” button right in the app so folks can easily get a glimpse of LZX, the language of Laszlo applications. Peter Andrea whipped up some art. Mark Davis came up with a name. What’s next?</p>
<p>We’re collaborating, but everyone is doing something different. It’s really faciliated by the fact that that we’re working with a couple of text files and some linked art assets. Each of us is doing not much work, but it builds up gradually. It seems this little project is a microcosm of what a lot of folks are doing with larger prpjects, using blogs as a communications medium for facilitating loosely connected collaboration.</p>
<p>I was interested using <a href="http://topicexchange.com/">TopicExchange</a>, so I thought I would track the history of this project so far as seen in blog posts. I dug up links to various posts and started adding them to a <a href="http://topicexchange.com/t/laszlo_blogbox/">blogbox topic</a>. After 6 entries, the form won’t respond. I don’t know if its just this topic or a general issue. Yet another work in progress :) I’ll check back later. In the meantime, I’ve posted the <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/notes/blogbox_history.html">thread of conversation</a> as html, if you are interested.</p>
