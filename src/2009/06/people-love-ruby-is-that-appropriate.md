People love Ruby… “is that appropriate?” Dave Thomas asks, “is a software tool something that should be the object of our love?”

> “programmers, like poets, constantly start with a blank piece of paper… so we have to love our tools, since otherwise we grow frustrated and that ends up showing in our work.”

I enjoyed <span class="caption">[Dave Thomas’ RubyConf 2008 keynote](http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/keynote.html) in which he challenged the Ruby enthusiasts in the audience to f\*\*k Ruby (get your mind out of the gutter, he meant \*fork\*) to show love for the language. Perhaps this talk was the genesis of “[fork is the new friend](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/05/fork-is-the-new-friend/)” or perhaps that idea is new for me but well known for community.</span>

Dave’s talk sheds light on delightful corners of the Ruby Language and is worth checking out. I’m increasingly enamored of open source tools that I use in my daily work and find that spending a little time now and then to contribute a patch or edit a wiki will streamline my later work and brings a joy akin to gardening.
