<h1>Sharkle: yet another social video site</h1>

<p>Sharkle, launched in September 2005, is a nice entry into the social video space. The interface is pretty clean, and it does a nice job of keeping you surfing by suggesting related videos. Their Flash video player works well, but is sometimes slow to start.</p>
<p>Highlights from my visit (click on image to see video):<br>
