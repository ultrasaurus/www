<h1>simplicity = more joy + less work</h1>

<p>John Maeda <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/172/">talks</a> about simplicity (via <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2007/09/john_maeda_simplicity_patterns.html">information aesthetics</a>). The talk itself is long and rambling, but quite funny and thought-provoking and I enjoyed watching the whole talk. In his book there are ten laws. In this talk he simplifies it and presents a single law. I liked the analogies by which he presented his law of simplicity.</p>
<p>When presented with a big cookie or a small cookie, which cookie will a child choose?</p>

<p>However, when presented with a pile of laundry to fold, surprisingly, the child will not choose the larger pile.</p>

<p>Maeda summarizes this as a law of simplicity: living life with more enjoyment and less pain.<br>

<p>Why do I find it hard to apply this basic principle in my life? I don’t know what’s up with that, but I find it amusing and helpful to say to myself now and then: LESS WORK, BIG COOKIE.</p>
