<h1>science is fun</h1>

<p>This school year my weekly volunteering effort has been teaching hands-on science to my son’s first grade class. As usual, I turned to the Internet for inspiration and once I got on the right track I have found an endless supply of great resources for doing science experiments with supplies easily found around the house and in grocery stores. It’s kind of like part-time home-schooling.</p>
<p>Whenever I find good stuff on the web, I am inspired to give back in kind. So, I’ve been working on a web site that documents the science experiements that I’ve done so far. I hope to inspire other people who are interested in volunteering or who already work with kids. You don’t have to be a parent to do it! Call up your local school and chances are that they would love you to come and work with the kids.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://www.flyingpaperclips.com">flyingpaperclips.com</a>, named after our most recent science experiment. My son thinks the name is too silly and that the paperclips were not really flying, they were floating. He says that I should have name it scienceprojects.com, but he’s too young to understand the profileration of domain names and that name was taken. Besides it’s my site and I like the name.</p>
