<h1>snaptell identifies media from captured images</h1>

<p>Ok, I haven’t raved about my iPhone yet, because, aside from the awesome <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000352.html">cinematic interface</a>, my favorite feature has been that I can listen to my voice mail in any order with a graphical UI, which is, frankly, not so remarkable…. but today I read about a remarkable app from <a href="http://www.snaptell.com/">SnapTell</a> which made me feel like I’m living in the future….</p>
<p><a href="http://cogdogblog.com/2008/10/19/mobile-magic/">Alan Levine has detailed the SnapTell experience</a> (via blog <a href="http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/printing-out-online-course-materials-with-embedded-movie-links/#comment-450">comment</a>). With my iPhone I took a photo of 3 random books on my side table and they were quickly cataloged with wikipedia references and google searches.</p>
<p>This seems way cooler than <a href="http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/printing-out-online-course-materials-with-embedded-movie-links/">QR tagging</a> which seems to be <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?w=37996646802%40N01&amp;q=qr+code+japan&amp;m=text">popular in Japan</a>. Why create a weird looking block code? Why not just snap a photo of a company logo or storefront to find a webpage?</p>
