The Laszlo Developer Group haeld an interesting meeting last week. We didn’t cover the full agenda. Most of the time with Max Carlson presenting various particle systems. Each was based on a simple set of foundation classes that let you define behaviors for individual “boids” that combine to create group behavior such as swarming, flocking or a springy mesh.

At first glance, these patterns seem fun, yet impractical for web applications. However, …. could apply to applications that require you to display or interact with complex or arbitrarily clustered data.
