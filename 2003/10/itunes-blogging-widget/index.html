<h1>iTunes blogging widget</h1>

<p><a href="http://pt.withy.org/ptalk/">ptw</a> has adapted the OPML viewer to display his currectly playing iTunes. (PC users have to go find a Mac to see it.) The integration with iTunes via AppleScript is the new special sauce. As you can see from the <a href="http://mylaszlo.com/lps/ptw/tunaroll/tunaroll.lzx?lzt=source">code</a>, the app still imports OPML and the LZX changes are purely user interface.
