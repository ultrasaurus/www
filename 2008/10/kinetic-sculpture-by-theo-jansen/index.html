<h1>kinetic sculpture by theo jansen</h1>

<p>“The boundaries between art and engineering exist only in our minds.”</p>
<p>I love the fluid feel of Theo Jansen’s work. (It’s worth looking up some of his other creations on YouTube.) This one feels like some kind of mystical wind creature. Most impressive, though, is the way that this extraordinary act of engineering is made to seem effortless.</p>
