<h1>Bullets don&amp;#8217;t kill Learning&amp;#8230;</h1>

<p>“Bullets don’t kill learning, but improper use of bullets kills learning.” –Richard Mayer</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.sociablemedia.com/articles_mayer.htm">The Cognitive Load of PowerPoint</a>, an interview by <a href="http://www.sociablemedia.com/">Cliff Atkinson</a> with <a href="http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/mayer/">Richard Mayer</a>.</p>
<p>Richard Mayer relates several principles from his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0521787491&amp;tag=ultrasaurus-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Multimedia Learning</a> which are applicable to PowerPoint, as well as any type of presentation. While these seem obvious, I often find it helpful and interesting to have good sense boiled down to some basic principles presented in a handy list (is that the signaling principle?).</p>
<p>* <strong>multimedia principle</strong>, in which people learn better from words and pictures than from words alone;<br>
* <strong>coherence principle</strong>, in which people learn better when extraneous material is excluded rather than included;<br>
* <strong>contiguity principle</strong>, in which people learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented at the same time or next to each other on the screen;<br>
* <strong>modality principle</strong>, in which people learn better from animation with spoken text than animation with printed text;<br>
*<strong>signaling principle</strong>, in which people learn better when the material is organized with clear outlines and headings;<br>
*<strong>personalization principle</strong>, in which people learn better from conversational style than formal style.</p>
