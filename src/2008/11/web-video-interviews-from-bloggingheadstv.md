[bloggingheads.tv](http://bloggingheads.tv) offers an interesting format for interviews where you see the interviewer and interviewee side-by-side, which they call a diavlog (a term I can’t quite imagine using in conversation). The interviews appear to be recorded with webcams and a phone call.

They offer some neat playback features: the ability to link into a video (but I don’t see that I can make my own link) and the ability to playback the auido/video at a faster speed, which is surprisingly usable (although I wish I had a scrubber interface for the speed of the video, rather than simply the “1.4” button which appears to switch playback to an alternate video file).

I enjoyed listening to bits of a few interviews. The one below was fun, although it starts slow, you can start in the middle [what’s the point of sex?](http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/15721?in=00:41:51&out=00:51:28) which discusses some scientific perspectives on the topic. The parts about free will and the placebo effect were pretty interesting too.
