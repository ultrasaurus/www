In keeping a web log, I’ve noticed that good information and interesting people find me. Christian Walker called this phenomenon a reverse search engine.

I find that the more I write about topics that interest me, the less I need to to surf the web via key word searches. I still love google, but more frequently I find interesting sites through [technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) and trackback.

Interesting sites I’ve found:  
– [Usable Design Media](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vgondi/)  
– [Cogworks](http://cogworks.manilasites.com/)  
– [Peter Lindberg](http://tesugen.com/)

People really do make the best librarians.
