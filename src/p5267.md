h2&gt;Who Cares?

Whenever I begin a software project, I like to dive into the obvious questions. I have had the opportunity to collaborate with [Ruben Verbough](http://ruben.verborgh.org/), an expert in Named Entity Recognition, who challenged me to answer the question of why this matters. If we are successful at linking collections across archives and museum, who cares? who will use this? why do we think it will matter?
