<h1>interactive booklist application</h1>

<p>Oliver Steele has added an interactive booklist to his <a href="http://www.osteele.com/">blog</a> (scroll all the way to the bottom on the left). He has a wonderful <a href="http://www.osteele.com/archives/2003/10/laszlo_booklist_application.html">description</a> of how it was developed — only 42 lines of code, written in <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/">Laszlo</a>. It’s pretty nifty, and especially useful for a long booklist.</p>
<p>Its neat to see this kind of leight-weight user interface in a rich internet application. Immersive experiences are great, but its also good to remember that we can add fluid and elegant user experence to augment an HTML page. I like Oliver’s approach of blending the background of the app seemlessly in the web page.</p>
