I’ve gotten a number of requests for follow-on training in San Francisco for Rails and the Ruby language, so here are some classes coming up in January.

Ruby on Rails class
-------------------

Another [Ruby on Rails training at Marakana](http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html?a=sarah) is coming up January 19-22 — the deadline for early bird discount is Dec 29. I was pleased to hear positive feedback from the test-first teaching approach:

> I really love the emphasis on test driven development and the use of tests as a way to move students along in exercises. This is definitely the way to teach. I highly commend you folks for doing it. It provided instant feedback on how successful my coding was, and provided a good guideline for successful coding in my profession. — Reed College

> One thing Marakana did extremely well was provide unit tests with labs. This one technique alone will now represent the standard I hold all future training courses to. It made training more than learning, it made it about problem solving. It made learning fun. — Near Infinity

**Scholarship**. Marakana will again be offering a scholarship spot (deadline Jan 12). If you feel that your presence will increase diversity in the Ruby on Rails community and that taking this class could have a positive impact on your life and you would not otherwise be able to afford the class, please fill out [this short form](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdpay16SEJ0dWF4UUhFYUdvc1NDemc6MA). Our decision on the candidate will balance your need, how much taking this course will have a beneficial effect and your potential impact on the community. Bonus points for bloggers and twitterers or people who otherwise spread their know-how.

Ruby language class
-------------------

Liah Hansen and I will be teaching a new [Ruby language class](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/12086083/) which will be 6 weekly evening classes with homework assignments in between. I didn’t set up a scholarship form for the Ruby language class, since it is less expensive, but would consider an application for this class as well — just add a note to the first field in the [form](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdpay16SEJ0dWF4UUhFYUdvc1NDemc6MA).

If you sign up for both classes, we’ll give you a $200 discount on the Marakana class.

Advanced Rails class
--------------------

Wolfram Arnold will be teaching an [advanced Rails class](http://marakana.com/training/ruby/advanced_rails.html?a=sarah) on Jan 25-28, the week after my introductory class. This will be a good companion to the first class or a way to sharpen your skills if you are already working with Rails.
