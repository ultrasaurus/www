[Charles Miller describes](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/07/17/understanding_engineers_feasibility) how engineers express the level of difficulty of solving a problem (via [Ron K. Jeffries](http://blog.eronj.com/2007/07/18/charles-miller-understanding-engineers-feasibility/)). He has some great descriptions of each level of difficulty, which I found quite accurate:

\* Impossible  
\* Unfeasable  
\* Non-Trivial  
\* Very Hard  
\* Hard  
\* Trivial

I’ve added “straightforward” to my language, which describes trivial problems that will still require some time to implement. I find it helpful in talking to non-engineers and to other engineers who might argue with my characterization of a given problem as “trivial.”
