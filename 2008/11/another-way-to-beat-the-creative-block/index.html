<h1>another way to beat the creative block</h1>

<p>Eric Karjaluoto argues that sometimes you just need to keep at it to gain great inspiration and creative solutions. He spent some time asking designers how they <a href="http://www.smashlab.com/files/press/beat_the_creative_block.pdf">beat the creative block</a> and felt that he did get any really good answers. Then finally it stuck him: “these people don’t have a quick-fix, they simply keep working.”</p>

<p>“The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas” Linus Pauling</p>
<p>“Amateurs look for inspiration; the rest of us just get up and go to work” Chuck Close</p>
