“begin with the unconditional rejection of organized mass violence and seek to think through the concrete problems of present international relations in new terms”

“New conditions demand new responses. We have tried here to suggest a new response. We hope the reader will bring to it an open mind, and if in any way challenged, will join in a serious effort to explore farther the lines of thought we have suggested.”

“. . . our age will be remembered chiefly neither for its horrifying crimes nor for its astonishing inventions but for its having been the first age… in which people dared to think it practicable to make the benefits of civilization available for the whole human race.”‘  
–ARNOLD J. TOYNBEE

“Little less than a century ago the Swiss historian, Jacob Burckhardt, prophesied the coming of a new order of barbarians whom he called the Terrible Simplifiers, who would govern Western society by applications of force and terror on a scale no one had ever used before. ”

“man’s indifference to violence is almost as disturbing a symptom of our time as his readiness to practice it.”

“It is also an age in which individual personality is being crushed by the spread of totalitarian doctrines. The growth of centralized authority, whether it stems from ideological concepts, from military necessity, or simply from the complexity of industrialized life, is producing a depersonalized society in which men are pressed into a common mold and made to conform to accepted standards of thought and behavior. The noble concept of the supremacy of the individual, so deeply rooted in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, is rapidly losing ground to various forms of totalitarianism. **Centralized authority, rather than individual conscience, is the dominant force in large segments of East and West alike.**”  
— social media has made individual voices relevant, but there seems no place for *individual conscience*
