<h1>data visualization with cartograms</h1>

<p>Jon Udell <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/11/18/visual-numeracy-for-collective-survival/">writes about visual numeracy</a>, introducing a new graph to continue the <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000507.html">conversation</a> about where the <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/11/09/where-the-oil-comes-from-not-from-where-i-thought/">US gets its oil</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s his original map of US oil imports by region:<br>

<p>Here’s his latest graph about where the global oil reserves are:<br>

<p>Comments on Udell’s <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/11/18/visual-numeracy-for-collective-survival/">latest post</a> point out that this kind of graph is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram">cartogram</a>, which is a map where areas are scaled to indicate the scalar value of the statistic that is being displayed on the map.</p>
<p>My favorite (via <a href="http://ouseful.wordpress.com/">Tony Hirst</a>) is from a series on <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/">2008 election results</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/"><img src="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/statepopredblue512.png" alt=""></a><br>
Popular vote results displayed on a map of the US.</p>
<p>Update: further reading in the comments reveals an interesting insight by <a href="http://www.librarything.com/">Tim</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The thing that irritates me about the first visualization is that by visualizing some data you imply that the data is important. But visualizations, like statistics can lie.</p>
<p>‘In fact, where the US gets its oil is almost completely irrelevant. The oil market is a world market. The transportation costs are startlingly small but-all things being equal-it’s easier to get oil from countries that are near you (and hard to get it from countries you don’t trade with).</p>
<p>“The ‘dangerous disconnect’ between American perception–the US is dependent on Middle Eastern oil–and the reality–we get a lot of our oil from Canada–is actually misunderstanding that is *healthier* than the misunderstanding the chart might lead one to take.</p>
<p>“Reading the chart one might imagine that, if the Middle East were plunged into a giant multi-state war, we’d be basically fine. Of course, unless the United States invaded Canada-and Africa, yay!-and commandeered all the oil for US consumption, we’d be in the grip of massive undersupply and a resulting rise in the price of oil.<br>
It’s also worth saying that reserve numbers have all sorts of spin on them…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think the graphs help illustrate the conversation. Your mind doesn’t have to do a double-step between a list of numbers and the narrative that discusses them. Graphing statistics helps tell a story, but as Tim says it is only part of the story. We need to fill in the causal effects and the consequence, and in doing so, draw conclusions and learn.</p>
