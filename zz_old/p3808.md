**The timing couldn’t possibly be**

more inopportune. Just as the

CD-ROM development herd is

writhing in its long-awaited

death throes, Macromedia has

rushed forward with a

life-support tech infusion –

Shockwave is a blast of morphine

that’ll keep the abysmal

content-repurposing nightmare in

deep REM. If you had any doubts

about what the fate of over five

years of largely worthless

Director content would be, make

no mistake: it’s coming to the

Web in its full <cite>Grandma Bear On</cite>

Quaaludes, <cite>Around-the-World in</cite>

80 Miserable Minutes,

<cite>Mix-Your-Own David Bowie</cite>

Digizine glory. The SOMA truism

may be that multimedia is a

solution in search of a problem,

but most of us are starting to

see it more as the problem

itself.

All the excitement generated at

last week’s massively-attended

[Macromedia International User](http://www.macromedia.com/Industry/Macro/Ucon/)

[Conference](http://www.macromedia.com/Industry/Macro/Ucon/) can’t mask the fact

that Shockwave is a poor method

to a poorer madness. Sure,

Director developers are bound to

see it as a minor miracle in

that repurposing their old crap

for the Web will just be a short

drag-and-drop away, but look at

the end result: a single

poorly-compressed,

long-downloading, non-streaming

file. “But, hey, it’s inline!”

[![[Don't be a Dupe!]](http://www.suck.com/daily/95/11/03/piracy.gif)](http://www.spa.org/piracy/homepage.htm)

We never thought we’d be saying

this, but when it comes to

Shockwave authoring, the

barriers to entry are just too

*low*. By now, every goon with a

Mac has either ponied up the

$1K+ for Director or, more

likely, has scored a pirated

copy from an unscrupulous buddy.

It’d be nice to imagine that

this would bring authoring

ability to creative (but

programming-challenged) net

media upstarts, but that’s the

longshot scenario. More likely,

it’ll only take a few times

getting burned by mammoth

Shockwave downloads with dubious

payoffs to keep most websurfers

from venturing willingly into

.dir/.fgd territory.
