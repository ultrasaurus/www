I was excited to participate in the [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/) Mobile Summit last Friday. Elesterama has a [nice write-up of the keynote](http://www.elsterama.com/rww-mobile-summit-keynote-top-mobile-trends-2010), which was followed by an unconference led by the fabulous [Kaliha Hamlin](http://www.kaliya.net/). The unconference format puts the hallway track front and center. The hot topics of the day were geolocation and the “internet of things.” I attended sessions on mobile video, cross platform application design and development, mobile analytics, identity and privacy — all very engaging and relevant.

Memorable quotes from the day:![](http://img.skitch.com/20100510-takwhfhb3iygp6pc5u4u7gfn6y.png)

Q: Do you do formal partnerships with the news organizations? A: they are more like conversations. — Jim Spencer, [Newsy](http://www.newsy.com/)

“Sampling sells” — Jim Spencer, [Newsy](http://www.newsy.com/)

“the user experience doesn’t begin when the user starts clicking, it starts much earlier than that… in their minds when they think about using the app” — Nick Bicanic, [Echo Echo](http://echoechome.wordpress.com/)

Cross-Platform Roundup
----------------------

With a specific inter

[Echo Echo](http://echoecho.me) is a cross-platform library for finding where friends are located (5 platforms: iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, Nokia S60, and WinMo). Nick explained how the design of user interface elements varies cross-platform. The UI implements platform conventions, yet also borrows good ideas from other platforms. The new BlackBerry version ([full screenshots here](http://echoechome.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/new-blackberry-version-1-5/)) ![](http://img.skitch.com/20100510-b95mdfhe87q13c58use7xt6a5g.png) borrows a badge notification from iPhone UI as well as implementing the standard BlackBerry notifiers. On Android (see [full screen shots](http://echoechome.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/new-android-version-1-5/)), the menu bar notifier comes with a slide open list of notifications, as is standard on Android. ![](http://img.skitch.com/20100510-bqumpa7qka18nghpr883979hc4.png)

[Micello Maps](http://micello.com/) runs on iPhone and Android with near identical interfaces. Prakash Narayan told the story of implementing first using PhoneGap, but finding that the UI was not responsive. He had more success implementing the applications natively on each platform.

 WorldMate, a travel applications, runs on iPhone, BlackBerry, Android, Nokia and Samsung s60, and WinMo. These folks pride themselves on having the best consumer experience and have been at it for a while, so all of their apps are native.

[Yapper](http://yapper.sachmanya.com/) (Your APP makER) demonstrated their web-based tool for creating RSS-readers for iPhone/iPad and Android.

I also enjoyed a series of demos after lunch, called “speed geeking,” where 12 tables were set up with demos and we switched every 5 minutes. At the end of the day, I was delighted to meet Richard McManus who I follow as [@rww](http://twitter.com/rww) on twitter. ![](http://img.skitch.com/20100509-g81caf5nrn73qprpdusgp36t4y.png)
