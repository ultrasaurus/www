<h1>processing</h1>

<p>I’ve enjoyed experimenting with the “alpha” relase of <a href="http://www.proce55ing.net">processing</a> (via <a href="http://63.144.246.231/information/archives/000165.html">Sam Wan</a>). It’s a fun new programming environment which is good at creating freeform animations and playing with colors in space. (There are examplefs of sound and camera input in the <a href="http://proce55ing.net/software/index.pl">exhibition area</a>, but I haven’t gotten that far myself.)</p>
<p>Here are two interactive pieces that I made. It was fun to remember trignometry. It has been a long time since I wrote code to animate a simple bounce. Processing let me focus on the core of the pattern without worrying about the mundane details (at least until I had to draw a button). This will be a great teachnig language, and it is quite impressive for an early release.</p>
