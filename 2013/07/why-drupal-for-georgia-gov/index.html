<h1>why drupal for georgia.gov</h1>

<p><em>2013-07-26</em></p> 


<p><a href="http://nikofthehill.com/">Nikhil Deshpande</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/nikofthehill">@nikofthehill</a>) is the Director of <a href="http://portal.georgia.gov/interactive/">GeorgiaGov Interactive</a> a group within the Georgia state government that provides services to agencies and other government organizations. Today at <a href="http://capitalcamp.org/">CapitalCamp</a> he talked about why they chose Drupal for <a href="http://georgia.gov/">georgia.gov</a> and how they approached the transition.</p>
<p>Georgia.gov, as the website for the Georgia state government, used to be simply a landing page with links. They wanted it to be a front door to wherever you wanted to go in the state government, but people were coming there and falling off. They had a fragmented experience, a fragmented brand. They were running many different CMS’s. They had both platform issues and a design challenge.</p>
<p>Their users don’t look like typical personas. They are trying to be a website for everyone, to serve the whole population. How do they do this? Here are my rough notes on this intriguing talk.</p>
<h2>Platform Choice</h2>
<p>Since they were running a lot of CMS’s, they knew exactly what they needed:</p>
<ol>
<li>to have an enterprise element, they were hosting 60-70 websites</li>
<li>cost effective (not saying cheap) — worthwhile, but doesn’t cost as much as others</li>
<li>simple and usable</li>
<li>strong presence in the public sector</li>
</ol>
<p>Nikhil Deshpande stated that Drupal is the second largest CMS worldwide, 2.1% of the web. [note: <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all">w3techs reports</a> Drupal as #3 at 2%, which is still pretty huge, but perhaps Joomla has grown in the past few years.]</p>
<h3>Open Source!</h3>
<p>Nikhail saw this as opportunity to answer valid questions about open source solutions, since they were moving from mostly proprietary systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>security? high threshold of security since it has so many eyes on it</li>
<li>free? how good can it be if it is free? It’s not free. It’s free as in free speech, not free beer.</li>
<li>total cost of ownership? you need to implement it and host it</li>
</ul>
<p>Who uses it? Huge number of government sites, including go.usa.gov, USDA, NASA, Dept of Justice, USAID, and many more.</p>
<p>You can either implement it yourself or get someone to implement it for you. They sent out a bid and chose Phase 2 as a partner. Then Phase 2 brought in Acquia (started by the founder of Drupal) and mediacurrent. They decided to use OpenPublic platform, which is built very specifically for the government. It’s a distribution of Drupal that you can customize or use out-of-the-box.</p>
<ul>
<li>tailored to the needs of govt</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>accessibility</li>
<li>workflow</li>
</ul>
<h3>Moving from Vignette to Drupal</h3>
<p>Content: Oracle to MySQL<br>
Look and feel — not just a migration, decided to do a re-design.<br>
Single code-base, multiple databases<br>
Cloud hosting — all public info, no sensitive data<br>
Search<br>
Mobile ready – 20% of traffic overall (and climbing), some websites up to 45%</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>Internal team designed the main site, then Phase 2 did the rest of the websites<br>
did heat maps — search 31% clicks, child support 13%, headlines 3.6%</p>
<p>Made it very search centric. They got a Google Search Applicance and indexed all of the Georgia government websites.</p>
<h2>55 redesigns?</h2>
<p>Nope…</p>
<ul>
<li>template based</li>
<li>styletiles as a design methodology</li>
<li>demo websites for agencies based on the styletiles</li>
</ul>
<p>4 main themes — agencies could choose: patriotic, friendly, official, classic</p>
<p>No one really likes change, but if you communicate well it can go smoothly.</p>
<p>56 sites, 8 batches, 150 content managers<br>
Oct 2011 – Sept 2012<br>
on time &amp; budget<br>
Best of Web — 2012 Innovation Award<br>
99.98% Uptime<br>
Savings 4.7MM in 5 years</p>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>define success</li>
<li>communicate &amp; involve (120 people who were trained at content managers, decision-makers, who signed off on the look of the website)</li>
<li>carefully select implementation partner, but also build a strong internal team</li>
</ul>
<p>No one wants to be on the receiving end of a change. It is important to communicate “things are going to be hard for you, but this is what we are doing to make it work.”</p>
