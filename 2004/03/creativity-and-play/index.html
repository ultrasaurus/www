<h1>creativity and play</h1>

<p>“It is the essence of play that a new relation is created between the field of meaning and the visual field — that is, between situations in thought and real situations.” — Vygotsky <u>Mind in Society</u></p>
<p>“most of us are so busy trying to solve problems that we fail to notice that in solving problems we sometimes rob ourselves of the opportunity to learn something new.” <a href="http://www.humansandcomputing.org/archives/000035.html">Michael Hamman</a> offers an interesting equation:</p>
<p>Creativity = competence + a desire to create a problem.</p>
<p>I agree that creativity requires competence, or at least confidence. I have observed in the development of software that I experience two extremes. One is where writing software is work. I relentlessly chase a bug. I perfect a piece of code through sheer persistence and fortitude. It can be satisfying, but it is not fun. The other extreme is where writing software is play. I can’t imagine that someone pays me for such challenging entertainment. Experimentation yields unexpected solutions. The patterns revealed by the trail of a bug lead to insights. Crafting a solution is a tangible, creative experience.</p>
<p>I often wonder what key factors create the experience of play. When I capture that way of working, I am undeniably more productive. I can see no down side to taking that approach all of the time, except that its not a state consciously achieved. One could argue that some things are just no fun. However, I don’t believe that the level of play is inherent to the task.</p>
