[HyperScope ](http://www.hyperscope.org), a modern Ajax-ified version of Doug Engelbart’s Augment System, is released as open source (under GPL) in its initial version. There’s a [demo](http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augmentinghumanintellect.opml) of the system which presents some of Doug Engelbart’s writing and is a good way to get to know the goals of the system. There is a [lauch party](http://blueoxen.net/c/hyperscope/blog/archives/23) tonight.

from [AUGMENTING HUMAN INTELLECT: A Conceptual Framework](http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augmentinghumanintellect.opml). (direct link to quote [1a2](http://hyperscope.org/hyperscope/src/demos/augmentinghumanintellect.opml#1A2))  
By Douglas C. Engelbart.

It is so exciting to see this technology which was ground-breaking (and fully functioning!) in the 1960s brought forward as an open source project. Congratulations to [everyone](http://hyperscope.org/community/index.html) who made it happen.
