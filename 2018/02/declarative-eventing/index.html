<h1>declarative eventing</h1>

<p>An emerging pattern in server-side event-driven programming formalizes the data that might be generated by an event source, then a consumer of that event source registers for very specific events.</p>
<p>A <strong>declarative eventing</strong> system establishes a contract between the producer (event source) and consumer (a specific action) and allows for binding a source and action without modifying either.</p>
<p>Comparing this to how traditional APIs are constructed, we can think of it as a kind of reverse query — we reverse the direction of typical request-response by registering a query and then getting called back every time there’s a new answer. This new model establishes a specific operational contract for registering these queries that are commonly called event <em>triggers</em>.</p>
<p>This pattern requires a transport for event delivery. While systems typically support HTTP and RPC mechanisms for local events which might be connected point-to-point in a mesh network, they also often connect to messaging or streaming data systems, like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, as well as proprietary offerings.</p>
<p>This declarative eventing pattern can be seen in a number of <em>serverless</em> platforms, and is typically coupled with Functions-as-a-Service offerings, such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions.</p>
<p><strong>An old pattern applied in a new way</strong></p>
<p>Binding events to actions is nothing new. We have seen this pattern in various GUI programming environment for decades, and on the server-side in many Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) frameworks. What’s new is that we’re seeing server-side code that can be connected to managed services in a way that is <em>almost</em> as simple to set up as an onClick handler in HyperCard. However, the problems that we can solve with this pattern are today’s challenges of integrating data from disparate systems, often at high volume, along with custom analysis, business logic, machine learning and human interaction.</p>
<p>Distributed systems programming is no longer solely the domain of specialized systems engineers who create infrastructure, most applications we use every day integrate data sources from multiple systems across many providers. Distributed systems programming has become ubiquitous, providing an opportunity for interoperable systems at a much higher level.</p>
