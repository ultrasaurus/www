Regular readers of this weblog will know that I’ve been working on [Laszlo Mail](http://www.laszlomail.com) for quite some time. For the most part, our focus has been licensing it to large ISPs; however, since launching it publicly on our own site, there has been huge interest from all sorts of folks who want to deploy it. I’m delighted the Laszlo has decided to offer it to anyone to download and try out. The team has put together an eval version which you can try for 30 days. For more info see the [Laszlo Mail blog](http://laszlomail.com/blog/2006/01/18/put-laszlo-mail-on-your-own-server/) or the [Laszlo Systems product page](http://www.laszlosystems.com/products/laszloMail/).
