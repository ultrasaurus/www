<h1>regular expressions are cool</h1>

<p>Along the theme of common sense reminders, I enjoyed reading <a href="http://gojko.net/2007/08/21/when-windows-are-not-enough">when windows are not enough</a> about how automating repetitive tasks is a key part of staying productive (and sane) when using computers. I like the “three strikes, you’re out” guideline for automation: when you find yourself doing something for the third time, write a script.</p>
<p>Towards the end Gojko Adzic talks about regular expressions, which every programmer should know and I don’t know well enough myself. Alexander Stigsen (via <a href="http://blog.eronj.com/2007/08/04/alexander-stigsen-explains-regular-expressions/">Ron Jeffries</a> has posted a <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/blog/2007/regular_expressions_tutorial">nice webcast and cheat sheet</a> if you’re looking to brush up on you regex skills.</p>
