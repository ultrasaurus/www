<h1>ruby and rails classes in january</h1>

<p><em>2009-12-29</em></p> 


<p>I’ve gotten a number of requests for follow-on training in San Francisco for Rails and the Ruby language, so here are some classes coming up in January.</p>
<h2>Ruby on Rails class</h2>
<p>Another <a href="http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html?a=sarah">Ruby on Rails training at Marakana</a> is coming up January 19-22 — the deadline for early bird discount is Dec 29. I was pleased to hear positive feedback from the test-first teaching approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really love the emphasis on test driven development and the use of tests as a way to move students along in exercises. This is definitely the way to teach. I highly commend you folks for doing it. It provided instant feedback on how successful my coding was, and provided a good guideline for successful coding in my profession. — Reed College</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing Marakana did extremely well was provide unit tests with labs. This one technique alone will now represent the standard I hold all future training courses to. It made training more than learning, it made it about problem solving. It made learning fun. — Near Infinity</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Scholarship</strong>. Marakana will again be offering a scholarship spot (deadline Jan 12). If you feel that your presence will increase diversity in the Ruby on Rails community and that taking this class could have a positive impact on your life and you would not otherwise be able to afford the class, please fill out <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdpay16SEJ0dWF4UUhFYUdvc1NDemc6MA">this short form</a>. Our decision on the candidate will balance your need, how much taking this course will have a beneficial effect and your potential impact on the community. Bonus points for bloggers and twitterers or people who otherwise spread their know-how.</p>
<h2>Ruby language class</h2>
<p>Liah Hansen and I will be teaching a new <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/12086083/">Ruby language class</a> which will be 6 weekly evening classes with homework assignments in between. I didn’t set up a scholarship form for the Ruby language class, since it is less expensive, but would consider an application for this class as well — just add a note to the first field in the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdpay16SEJ0dWF4UUhFYUdvc1NDemc6MA">form</a>.</p>
<p>If you sign up for both classes, we’ll give you a $200 discount on the Marakana class.</p>
<h2>Advanced Rails class</h2>
<p>Wolfram Arnold will be teaching an <a href="http://marakana.com/training/ruby/advanced_rails.html?a=sarah">advanced Rails class</a> on Jan 25-28, the week after my introductory class. This will be a good companion to the first class or a way to sharpen your skills if you are already working with Rails.</p>
