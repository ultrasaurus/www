<h1>when coding is like the ephemeral art of rock balancing</h1>

<p>not so random “timeout” link in a <a href="http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/printing-out-online-course-materials-with-embedded-movie-links/#comment-674">blog comment</a> by <a href="http://ouseful.info/">Tony Hirst</a></p>
<p>He relates balancing rocks to mashups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When I play with mashups – when I play with ideas – I’m balancing logic rocks. Sometimes they fall over, but that’s okay; if I wanted to build something a little longer lasting, I’d use concrete…. we need to find ways of exploring how to doodle with new technology.”</p>
