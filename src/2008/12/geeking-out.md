I’ve been learning Ruby on Rails over the past couple of days and have decided to chronicle my [adventures in code](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/code/) in a separate spot. I’ve found that my regular readers tend to be a diverse crowd and some of their eyes tend to glaze over when I’ve delved into the nitty details of code.

Feel free to join me over at [ultrasaurus.com/code](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/code/) if you like to write (or at least read about) code, although I will continue my still geeky, but less code-filled reflections here.
