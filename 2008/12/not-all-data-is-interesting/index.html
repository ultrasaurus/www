<h1>not all data is interesting</h1>

<p>Mathematician Martin Wattenberg <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2008/12/29/he_creates_ways_of_seeing_information/">interview by boston.com</a> about his exhibit at the Boston Museum of Modern art. (via <a href="http://technews.acm.org/archives.cfm?fo=2008-12-dec/dec-31-2008.html#393051">ACM TechNews</a>)</p>
<p>“The traditional approach to visualization in science and business is to create something transparent and neutral – a telescope with clear glass,” he said as he roamed through the ICA exhibit. “But for an emotional approach, or an artistic approach, you want to bring a point of view. Not all data is interesting. The art is pointing the telescope at the right set of data.”</p>
<p>You can see his work online at <a href="bewitched.com">bewitched.com</a>. I had seen <a href="http://bewitched.com/marketmap.html">Market Map</a>, <a href="http://bewitched.com/namevoyager.html">Name Voyager</a>, and others before, but <a href="http://bewitched.com/historyflow.html">History Flow</a> was new to me which visualized the editing history of wikipedia articles:</p>
