We toured [Harley Goat Farm](http://www.harleyfarms.com/) in Pescadero, CA yesterday. I highly recommend it — you need to make reservations in advance since it is busy baby goat season. I did, for a time, live and work on a goat farm, so I didn’t expect to learn anything new.

\[Update\] I <del datetime="2009-03-16T23:59:21+00:00">learned</del>was told that this breed of goats (I forget the name) wear their tonsils on the outside of their neck. However, a friend who has Nubian goats tells me they also have them and they are called “wattles.” Other [web sources](http://www.dairygoatjournal.com/issues/86/86-5/what_are_wattles.html) say they are also called “bells” or “skin tags” and appear to be found in many kinds of goats. “They serve no purpose and are believed to be a genetic trait ‘left over’ from evolution.” Hmmm. Does this mean they are not tonsils or just that the tonsil is inside the wattle? I suspect the former, so I’ve updated the picture below. I desperately hope that one of my readers is an expert in goat anatomy and can help clear this up.

They will spit at and kick coyotes to protect the goats!
