A simple adventure game, [Foobar the Barbarian](http://www.mylaszlo.com/lps/whisperstorm/foobar/foobar.lzx), is the first game I’ve seen written for the [Laszlo Presentation Server](http://www.laszlosystems.com).

It’s a neat idea to have the game-play driven from a simple XML file. I can imagine lots of creative folks who could write the “story” for a game, but who couldn’t (or wouldn’t want to) write the logic. I could imagine having doorways or transporters into other people’s worlds by allowing an url to load another dataset.
