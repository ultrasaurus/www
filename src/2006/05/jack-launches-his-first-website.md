Last week, my 8-year-old son, Jack, launched his first website (with a little technical help from mom). He has recently started reading chapter books, and I suggested that he could write up his thoughts about each book and publish them on the web. He was really into the idea and even thought up the domain name: [bookula.com](http://www.bookula.com). (Many thanks to Ryan Afdahl at [Media Temple](http://www.mediatemple.net) for helping set up the new domain.)

Jack wrote all the text, and plans to add a new book review every week. I set up links to Amazon, using my Amazon associates account, but Iâ€™ve promised that all the proceeds will go directly to him to buy whatever book he wants (or maybe some legos). Check it out!
