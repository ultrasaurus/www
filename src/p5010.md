I used to believe that creating a great corporate culture was something that you got to do after you have a successful business. My recent experience founding Blazing Cloud made me realize that I had that backward. Indiegogo founder, Danae Ringelmann, put this into words very effectively in a recent talk at the Women 2.0 conference.

Danae advises that we be intentional about creating our organization’s culture.

The Indiegogo founders got together and brainstormed why they were creating their company. They came up with four values, which they turned into an acronym: FACE = Fearless, Authentic, Collaborative, Empowering.

Being aligned with other people in your organization is an amplifier. Indiegogo seeks to democratize finance, empowering individuals to create campaigns that let them transform the world through physical goods, artworks or simply create experiences. Danae discovered that “our values influence who our customers are.” On a recent Tectonic Podcast, I relayed the story about how [a bunch of people on the Internet donated $700,000 to a bullied bus monitor](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/the_browser/2013/03/karen_klein_bullied_bus_monitor_why_did_a_bunch_of_people_on_the_internet.html). It’s a story about how an individual created an Indiegogo campaign that caused a ripple effect of like-minded people to take action in a way that echoes the values of the company itself. It is no coincidence that the platform embodies the values of its founders, who have managed to scale their original inspiration to almost 100 employees and millions of customers.

“You are creating culture with every action you take,” notes the Indiegogo founder. Culture is experienced and transmitted person-to-person though many small actions. We can develop rituals which embody our culture and teach our values to people who are new to our organization. When you walk through the Indiegogo San Francisco office, you see a hundred small indications of those values. The light fixtures, cubicle walls and whiteboard marker holders are all purchased from various Indiegogo campaigns.

Free meals, gym memberships, etc. are perks, not culture.
