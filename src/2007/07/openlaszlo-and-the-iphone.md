Although I am proud of our corporate management for setting aside its religious upbringing and recognizing some of the [serious limitations](http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/archives/2007/07/openlaszlo-and-the-iphone/) in this first incarnation of the [JesusPhone](http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/28/the_passion_of_the_j.html), it is exciting to see members of the [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org/) congregation diving in.

By all reports, [iPhoneDevCamp](http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp) brought together a lot of creative folks and sparked some [great apps](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/iphone-asks-wou.html). Ben Shine [writes about the experience](http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/archives/2007/07/our-first-iphone-app/) working with Bret Simister over the weekend and creating a new application from scratch in about a day and a half. And, of course, it had to have some of that “swooshy” (aka cinematic) UI. They decided on a [game](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/iphone-asks-wou.html), matching photos and news feeds from RSS stories. The game is [here](http://labs.openlaszlo.org/ipdc/newsmatch06/), and Ben has even posted the [source](http://svn.openlaszlo.org/sandbox/ben/smush) on svn (just 400 lines of LZX).

Update: for those of you experimenting with OpenLaszlo on the iPhone, please add comments or links to [wiki page](http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/IPhone_Experiences)
