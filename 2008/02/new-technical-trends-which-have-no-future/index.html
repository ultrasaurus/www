<p>JP Rangaswami (confused of calcutta) writes “<a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/02/03/interesting-but-of-no-commercial-value-the-problem-with-emerging-social-media-tools-a-saturday-evening-post/">Interesting, but of no commercial value</a>”: The problem with emerging social media tools: A Saturday Evening Post (via <a href="http://blog.eronj.com/2008/02/02/this-%e2%80%98telephone%e2%80%99-has-too-many-shortcomings-to-be-seriously-considered-as-a-means-of-communication-western-union-1876/">Cloudy Thinking</a>).</p>
<p>Rangaswami relates how often the bleeding edge technical trends are hard to recognize as significant until they are adopted by the masses. From email to web applications to social networks — all were considered odd fringe elements at first. I enjoyed reading his <a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/2008/02/03/interesting-but-of-no-commercial-value-the-problem-with-emerging-social-media-tools-a-saturday-evening-post/">whole post</a>.</p>
<p>He also highlights some gems collected by <a href="http://www.interstel.net/~jdpaul/stupidity.technology.html">JD Paul</a>. I followed the link and enjoyed reading all of them, but here are my faves:</p>
<p>“This ‘telephone’ has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.”<br>
–- Western Union internal memo, 1876.</p>
<p>“There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.”<br>
–Ken Olson, president, chairman and founder of Digital Equipment Corp., 1977</p>
<p>“The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?” –David Sarnoff’s associates in response to his urgings for investment in the radio in the 1920s.</p>
<p>“Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?” –H.M. Warner, Warner Brothers, 1927.</p>
<p>“640K ought to be enough for anybody.” — Bill Gates, 1981</p>
