<h1>OpenLaszlo and the iPhone</h1>

<p>Although I am proud of our corporate management for setting aside its religious upbringing and recognizing some of the <a href="http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/archives/2007/07/openlaszlo-and-the-iphone/">serious limitations</a> in this first incarnation of the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/06/28/the_passion_of_the_j.html">JesusPhone</a>, it is exciting to see members of the <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLaszlo</a> congregation diving in.</p>
<p>By all reports, <a href="http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp">iPhoneDevCamp</a> brought together a lot of creative folks and sparked some <a href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/iphone-asks-wou.html">great apps</a>. Ben Shine <a href="http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/archives/2007/07/our-first-iphone-app/">writes about the experience</a> working with Bret Simister over the weekend and creating a new application from scratch in about a day and a half. And, of course, it had to have some of that “swooshy” (aka cinematic) UI. They decided on a <a href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/07/iphone-asks-wou.html">game</a>, matching photos and news feeds from RSS stories. The game is <a href="http://labs.openlaszlo.org/ipdc/newsmatch06/">here</a>, and Ben has even posted the <a href="http://svn.openlaszlo.org/sandbox/ben/smush">source</a> on svn (just 400 lines of LZX).</p>
<p>Update: for those of you experimenting with OpenLaszlo on the iPhone, please add comments or links to <a href="http://wiki.openlaszlo.org/IPhone_Experiences">wiki page</a></p>
