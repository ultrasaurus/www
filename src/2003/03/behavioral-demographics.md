I was intrigued by the discussions of Microsoft’s new [3°](http://www.threedegrees.com) project,  
and in particular by Michael Gartenberg’s [observation](http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/gartenberg/archives/000264.html) that this software targets "a behavioral demographic not just an age demographic."

I never thought of it that way. I used to think that if we create compelling  
experiences for people on the internet — virtual places that give back more  
than people put into them, then this real-time online stuff would finally prove  
useful to the general population. Over time I’ve recognized that a lot of change  
needs to happen before any sufficiently new technology catches on. Email was  
around for decades, but it was the web which drove most people to  
hook up their PCs to the Internet.

Instant Messaging has emerged as the killer  
app in this category of connected applications. The buddy list and its expression  
of presence  
fundamentally changed the nature  
of chat. I find it interesting to think in terms of a behavioral demographic.  
If you don’t spend much of your time sitting in front of a connected  
PC, then Instant Messaging certainly loses its appeal.
