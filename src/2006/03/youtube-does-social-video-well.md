[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), launched in Feb 2005, seems to be one of the most popular social video sites on the web. It’s fast, has a nice clean interface and a nice selection of features:  
\* Flash video  
\* A description of the video (you’d be surprised how many sites don’t have this!)  
\* easily copied video URL and embedded player  
\* tags and ratings  
\* user info, friends, favortites, presence  
\* play lists  
\* trackback links with stats!

Even though [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/) does seem to be more well-known, I originally found it through [TagWorld](http://www.tagworld.com/) (which is now too slow to review). At the time amongst the less imaginative videos of girls dancing in front of the camera, I saw this fun home-grown music video “[hey clip](http://youtube.com/watch?v=-_CSo1gOd48)” hosted by YouTube. (Two young women lip-sync “Hey” by the Pixies.)

It’s nice to know the social video sites are being social with each other :)
