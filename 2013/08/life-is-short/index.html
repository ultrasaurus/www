<h1>learning photoshop</h1>

<p>I’m back in San Francisco where I can walk my dog in the morning and drive my kid to school. I actually went shopping to buy some of that fresh California produce I missed so much when I was in DC — perhaps I was just shopping at the wrong places. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67857234@N00/9563607246/" title="beet-sketch by sarah_allen2000, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7406/9563607246_3889149bc6_n.jpg" alt="beet-sketch"></a></p>
<p>This particular beet tempted me from the organic vegetables section of the supermarket.</p>
<p>I’m learning PhotoShop (again). I want to be competent with a wide range of tools — not just code. I indulged in the purchase of a pressure-sensitive tablet and experimented with the so-called pencils.</p>
<p>I’m collecting <a href="http://stitch.es/stitches/629/Learning-PhotoShop">tutorials and tools</a> through my learning path. I was inspired by the <a href="http://lpnorman.com/">Lindsay Norman</a> collection: <a href="http://stitch.es/stitches/482/Web-Design-for-Begin">Web Design for Beginners</a>.</p>
