<h1>touchscreens in taxicabs</h1>

<p>Minority Report style ads coming to taxicab near you. Ok, they aren’t reading your identity off your retina to display targeted ads, but GPS will display ads based on location. I had heard a few years ago that animated Flash ads were being placed on top of NYC taxis, but I can’t find a reference to that now. I did find this <a href="http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Out_of_Home_19/Your_client_s_ad_inside_New_York_taxis.asp">story</a><br>
about <a href="http://www.taxitechnology.com/">taxitechnology.com</a> which is offering ads on touchscreens in 13,000 New York taxicabs.<br>

<p>It’s hard to tell from the marketing materials, but it looks like this has been in the works for quite a while. I thought the <a href="http://www.etaxinewyork.com/demopage.asp">interface</a> was pretty ho hum for all the hi tech — shiny buttons, uninspired design. Any New Yorkers tried one yet? Is it cool or lame? helpful or intrusive?</p>
