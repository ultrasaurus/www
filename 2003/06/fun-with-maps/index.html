<h1>fun with maps</h1>

<p>Maps are a natural way to use images to visualize a lot of data in a small space, or even a little bit of data in an interesting way.</p>
<p>I was inspired by <a href="http://www.bryanboyer.com/indyjunior/">IndyJunior</a> to spend last Sunday afternoon experimenting with maps. Using the IndyJunior Flash application I mapped <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/indyjr/">places I’ve lived</a>. It’s a very easy process that consists of editing an XML file with your locations and clicking buttons in a nify configuration app that let’s you select the look-and-feel of the map.</p>
<p>The IndyLog also points to some other fun maps, like a <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/indyjr/guestmap.html">map guestbook </a> . Is it just a fun novelty to index notes by geographic location? or does it add meaning?</p>
