“In most people’s vocabularies, design means veneer. It’s interior decorating. It’s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service.” – Steve Jobs

I found the origin of this quote which I saw in the slideshow below at [inspireUX](http://www.inspireux.com/2008/05/05/design-is-the-fundamental-soul-of-a-human-made-creation/). Despite the soemtimes unreadable text and lack of clear attribution, I enjoyed this slideshow:
