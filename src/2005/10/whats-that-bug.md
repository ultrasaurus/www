I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve been unable to identify some cool new specimen. Unlike linguistic questions, like the [history of the letter C](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000051.html), identifying creatures by sight is pretty near impossible to research on the internet, or even with a book for the non-biologist. Now I’ve found: [whatsthatbug.com](http://www.whatsthatbug.com/).

The picture on the right comes from the [bug love](http://www.whatsthatbug.com/love_among_bugs.html) section. Not sure I quite understand the biology behind that, but it is entertaining. I can’t wait till our next trip to the park!
