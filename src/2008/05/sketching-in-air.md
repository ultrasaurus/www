Front design has developed [sketch furniture](http://www.frontdesign.se/sketchfurniture/), a method to “materialize free hand sketches”. This unique process combines two techniques: pen strokes in the air are recorded with motion capture as 3D digital files; then through rapid prototyping are turned into real pieces of furniture.

One YouTube commenter points out that the artists probably can’t actually see what they are sketching, which likely makes this problematic; however, I could see their adding heads-up display technology to improve the process in the future.

In any case, I would love to try out this system and sketch myself some new deck chairs!
