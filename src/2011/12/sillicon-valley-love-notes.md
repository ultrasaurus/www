We need more pop culture that show how strong men can be attracted to powerful, smart, technical women. A couple of years ago, I wrote about the rise in [hacker love songs](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/08/hacker-love-songs/) being a positive trend for women in computing. Today I saw [Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling](http://siliconvalleyryangosling.tumblr.com/).

I can’t count the number of times my sweetheart stayed up late with me and edited yet one more draft of an important proposal or word-smithed my bio to make me sound more impressive than I thought I was. We need new media portrayals of what it means to be loved in an honest and meaningful way.

While I wish it had been a guy, writing love notes for a girl, [Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling](http://siliconvalleyryangosling.tumblr.com/) was created by writer, artist and designer, [Lian Amaris](http://lianamaris.com/) ([@lianamaris](http://twitter.com/#!/lianamaris)).

I think Angie Chang said it well in [her post on Ryan Gosling Silicon Valley](http://www.women2.org/ryan-gosling-wants-you-to-raise-capital-to-grow-your-startup/):
