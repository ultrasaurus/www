<h1>kickstart book by john sundman</h1>

<p>John Sundman is working on a new book: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/john-sundman/creation-science">Creation Science</a>. He describes it as “a technothriller about scary science — like designer DNA, brain hacking &amp; mind control, computer viruses and biological viruses.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/john-sundman/creation-science"><img src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/john-sundman/creation-science/widget/card.jpg" alt=""></a>Please consider supporting the arts and this experiment by an independent writer in alternative book funding. You can <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/john-sundman/creation-science">pledge any amount</a>.</p>
<p>John has distributed his previous books for free on the web with a Creative Commons license, with a pledge of $15 or more you will receive a printed copy of the book when it is complete, but you can pledge smaller amounts just to support the effort, or if you can afford it, you can be a patron for $250 and get early drafts of the book.</p>
<p>I reviewed his <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2003/08/acts-of-the-apostles/">Acts of the Apostles</a> — my favorite of his three books, and just made a pledge to help him keep working on this one. I look forward to reading it. I think that kickstart provides a neat way for independent writers to be funded.</p>
