<h1>Gender Diversity in Web Conferences</h1>

<p>I was doing a little research for a friend and found some nice resources for women speakers. <a href="http://www.kottle.org">Jason Kottle</a> collected some <a href="http://www.kottke.org/07/02/gender-diversity-at-web-conferences">great stats</a> about representation of women at web conferences. Every year or so, someone asks me a question like this, so I thought I would post a few pointers.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s pretty awesome that people are collecting and publishing resources for conference organizers. I find the focused lists most effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flash Goddess has the a great <a href="http://www.flashgoddess.com/html/speakers.html">women speaker list</a> , with topics and details about each speakers area of expertise</li>
<li>LinuxChix offers <a href="http://www.linuxchix.org/chix-who-speak.html">Chix who Speak</a></li>
<li>BlogHer, of course, has great women who talk about blogging <a href="http://www.blogher.com/blogher-07-speakers">2007</a>, <a href="http://workerbees.typepad.com/BlogHer06DayTwo_WEB.html">2006</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.misbehaving.net/2005/11/collective_conf.html">Other</a> <a href="http://www.personism.com/2006/10/11/list-of-women-speakers-for-your-conference/">lists</a> are very broad, and it is hard to see what exactly people are expert at.</p>
<p>Know any lists I missed? Please comment and I will pass them on.</p>
