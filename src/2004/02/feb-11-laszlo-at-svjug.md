Serious Client-side Programming is Back: Rich Internet Applications, Web UI, and LZX by Eric Bloch &amp; David Temkin, Laszlo Systems, Inc

applications that enable Java developers to provide Web  
UIs that are on par with or go beyond tradition desktop UIs.

on to discuss LZX, Laszlo’s XML-based language, that  
enables development of Rich Internet Applications using  
industry standards, including XML, JavaScript, and XPath.
