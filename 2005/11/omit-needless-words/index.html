<h1>omit needless words</h1>

<p>There’s been some confusion about what laszlomail.com is for, despite the fact that we have text on the front page that says its for communication service providers. Doh! No one reads text.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sensible.com/">Steve Krug</a> suggests we should “omit needles words” in his book <a href="http://www.sensible.com/buythebook.html">Don’t Make Me Think</a>, A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Get rid of half the words on each page,<br>
then get rid of what’s left<br>
— Krug’s third law of usability</p>
