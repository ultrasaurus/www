<h1>shift happens</h1>

<p>Not so often these days do I see something on the web that really makes me think. This thought-provoking presentation was originally written by <a href="http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/">Karl Fisch</a>, technology director for a high school, as a presentation for a faculty meeting. His original title was “<a href="http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/2006/08/did-you-know.html">Did you know?</a>” Many thanks to <a href="http://www.rashmisinha.com">Rashmi </a>who highlighted the <a href="http://www.rashmisinha.com/archives/07_05/shift%20happens.html">roots of this presentation</a> which won a recent <a href="http://www.slideshare.net">slideshare</a> contest.</p>
<p>You should watch the whole slideshow, but in case you don’t, here’s my favorite part: We are currently preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist… using technologies that haven’t been invented… in order to solve problems we don’t even know are problems yet.</p>
<p>We live in exponential times.</p>
