<h1>sketching in air</h1>

<p>Front design has developed <a href="http://www.frontdesign.se/sketchfurniture/">sketch furniture</a>, a method to “materialize free hand sketches”. This unique process combines two techniques: pen strokes in the air are recorded with motion capture as 3D digital files; then through rapid prototyping are turned into real pieces of furniture.</p>

<p>One YouTube commenter points out that the artists probably can’t actually see what they are sketching, which likely makes this problematic; however, I could see their adding heads-up display technology to improve the process in the future.</p>
<p>In any case, I would love to try out this system and sketch myself some new deck chairs!</p>
