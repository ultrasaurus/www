<p>I just posted a new header graphic on this site: the artist’s interpretation of an ultrasaurus. Actually, it is a SWF. It will tell you if someone is also viewing the site. Try it with your friends (or you can cheat and open two browser windows).</p>
<p>It’s a work in progress. It’s not so much fun knowing someone is there if you can’t talk to them. As is, it seems spooky, or maybe just frustrating.</p>
