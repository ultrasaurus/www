I recently switched to Firefox. (The new 0.9 version that was release by [mozilla.org](http://www.mozilla.org/) on Monday) I am very happy with it. It seems snappier and I love the tabbed interface for browsing.

I believe that I needed to start voting with my behavior. Every web site I have ever worked on looks at their browser stats to figure out how compatible the HTML needs to be. I’ve recently seen a trend where sites will only work on IE. Developing cross-browser sites and testing across a multitude of browsers is a hassle, but if we stop doing that the web will become a less interesting and less safe place for web surfers and developers alike.

After I switched browsers, I that the “U.S. government’s Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) is warning Web surfers to stop using Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) browser.” via [internetnews.com](http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3374931)

I just feels good that an opensource offering is not only more secure, but provides a better user experience, than the commercial alternative.
