<h1>Laszlo goes open source</h1>

<p>Today <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com">Laszlo Systems</a> announced that the entire Laszlo platform, including Laszlo Presentation Server (LPS), the LZX language and associated examples and documentation will be released under an open source license. You can find out all the details at <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org">openlaszlo.org</a>.</p>
<p>Pinch me. I must be dreaming. Do I work for a cool company or what? Hats off to the pioneers who proved that open source software can also be commercially viable. I’ve been developing proprietary software forever, but in the last few years more and more people have started challenging the old school notions that source code needs to be top secret to be effective. Its pretty exciting to be working for a company that “gets it.”</p>
<p>By the way, we’re <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/company/jobs">hiring</a>.</p>
