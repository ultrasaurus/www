<h1>Interaction08 call for submissions</h1>

<p>I’m pleased to be invited to speak at <a href="http://beta.ixda.org/">Interaction08</a>, the first annual conference of the Interaction Design Association (IxDA) to be held in Savannah, Georgia, USA on February 8-10, 2008. I noticed that Dan Saffer, Conference Chair, has posted a <a href="http://beta.ixda.org/discuss.php?post=18636">call for submissions</a>.</p>
<p>The call is for “Lightning Session” submissions. I love the idea — only 25 minutes, one or two speakers. A short session requires a very focused topic and a series of these promises to be quite interesting. I look forward to checking these out at the conference. There are 14 open Lightning Session slots. The deadline is Sept 15. Submission form is <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=Jx8Syhywkw_2bumLuV1KJZGQ_3d_3d">here</a>.</p>
