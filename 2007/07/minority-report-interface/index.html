<h1>minority report interface</h1>

<p><em>2007-07-07</em></p> 


<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)">Minority report</a> is a must-see movie for UI geeks. It seems to have inspired a new generation of UI innovation, or perhaps, a new generation of designers and developers and Stephen Spielberg are all thinking along the same lines.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.gomonkey.at/product.shtml">some</a> <a href="http://news.com.com/1606-2_3-6096513.html?tag=ne.vid">inventions</a> that use cameras and <a href="http://www.imk.fhg.de/sixcms/detail.php?template=&amp;id=2239">Pointscreen</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV60gwiM5HM">video</a>) which works by sensing electric fields (inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin">Theremin</a>). But, none seem as responsive as the multi-touch interface demonstrated earlier this year by Jeff Han at the TED conference.</p>
<p>(this video via <a href="http://www.videokarma.com/todays-video/2006/11/25/minority-report-type-advanced-interface.html">Video Karma</a> via <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/01/iphone_and_the_.html">Creating Passionate Users comment</a>)</p>
<p>While everyone is wowed by this technology and wants to play with it, there is still question about how practical is will be in real life. “Ben Shneiderman, a computer science professor at the University of Maryland and a founding director of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab, calls Han a ‘great showman’ who has ‘opened the door to exciting possibilities.’ But he doesn’t think Han’s technology would be suitable for a large-scale consumer product, nor as useful as a mouse on a large display. If you are standing in front of the screen, Shneiderman wonders, how would people behind you be able to see what you’re doing?” (via <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/112/open_features-canttouchthis.html">Fast Company</a> via <a href="http://www.bassictech.com/blogs/bassictech_news_blog/archive/2007/01/20/remapping-the-universe-using-this-gui.aspx">BassicTech</a>) I think the main potential problem is that your arms will get tired; however, the potential risks of RSI didn’t stop consumer adoption of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Doug Englebart</a>‘s mouse.</p>
<p>I do think it would be pretty effective for collaboration. I always find it hard to sit back and just watch someone else “drive” when working together on a computer. Of course, we have a long way to go on collaboration software in general, let alone adapting it to this new paradigm. Regardless, I applaud Jeff’s innovation and wish him and his colleagues at <a href="http://www.perceptivepixel.com/">Perceptive Pixel</a> the best of luck. I wholeheartedly agree with Jeff Han when he says that “interfaces should be conforming to us.”</p>
