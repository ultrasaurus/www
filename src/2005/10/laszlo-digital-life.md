![](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/laszlo-digital-life.gif)The wonderful designers at [Laszlo](http://www.laszlosystems.com/) recently put together a nice presentation about the suite of applications that we plan to build. We’re calling it [Laszlo Digital Life](http://www.laszlosystems.com/digitallife/).

The first of these applications is [Laszlo Mail](http://www.laszlosystems.com/products/laszloMail/). We’re focused on creating a great user experience for web mail that approaches the experience of desktop mail applications with the added benefit of providing access to email from any computer with a web browser. It was released early this summer to [EarthLink](http://www.earthlink.net/) subscribers. We’re working on a putting up our latest and greatest so that anyone can check it out… stay tuned.
