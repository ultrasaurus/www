<h1>frogs, rodeos and human nature</h1>

<p>The myth was debunked in 1995, but I first read it this morning. I found it heartening to read <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/01/frog.html">this story about the old frog-boiling myth</a>.</p>
<p>I was was tipped off by “the unknown Flash Guy” who tells <a href="http://www.crinklink.com/Rodeo.htm">a story about a rodeo</a>, which itself could be a parable of human nature, if it weren’t also true.</p>
