<h1>いろは (iroha) hiragana basics</h1>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon"><img src="../../../uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-26-at-3.49.37-PM.png" alt="The gojūon is a Japanese ordering of kana named for the 5×10 grid in which the characters are displayed. Each kana corresponds to one sound in the Japanese language. "></a>Today I learned about いろは (iroha) a different way to learn Hiragana than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon">gojūon (五十音) ordering</a> I learned in my Japanese class, where the characters are displayed in a grid. It makes sense to teach that way since it is easy to see which share same beginning (consonant) sound or ending (vowel) sound.</p>
<p>However, I knew the characters once and wanted to make my study session more interesting. I had forgotten about half the characters since first studying Japanese four years ago and wanted to review using actual words. If I could learn the characters with the context of real language then I could learn vocabulary at the same time. I wondered if there were a “quick brown fox” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram">pangram</a>) for Hiragana.</p>
<p>I quickly found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha">いろは</a> (iroha) an ancient Japanese poem:</p>
<p>いろはにほへと<br>
ちりぬるを<br>
わかよたれそ<br>
つねならむ<br>
うゐのおくやま<br>
けふこえて<br>
あさきゆめみし<br>
ゑひもせす</p>
<p>This poem not just an arcane bit of trivia, but a real ABCs of Japanese, where the ordering from the poem is still used today. I found a wonderful video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kmtHTUUCvI">What is “いろは iroha”?</a> that tells the story of this word which means “basic” or “fundamental” in Japanese. I learned that the first 7 characters are used for musical notes (the way we use A-G, in Japanese they use いろはにほへと. I read elsewhere that theater seats are often ordered this way.</p>
<p>I realized that if I could learn this poem, I would also learn other useful aspects of the Japanese language and a glimpse of the culture as well. I wanted to hear it while I studied, and found answers via my new twitter friend Charelle Collett (<a href="https://twitter.com/Charcol1900">@Charcol1900</a>)</p>
<p>Here’s someone singing it in a child-like ABCs — no idea what the words on the right are, but this is the very clear to follow along and practice reading while hearing the characters pronounced:</p>

<p>and here’s Hatsune Miku (Vocal software) singing it:</p>

<p>This second one is really interesting since it also shows the evolution of early Japanese script into modern Hiragana and then shows some more variants — here’s some detail on the first three.</p>
