<h1>on snail mail and the virtual office</h1>

<p>ChrisK at <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/">Gliffy</a> writes <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/blog/2008/08/04/handling-snail-mail-in-a-virtual-office/">about a new service</a> which will scan and forward postal mail via email. Using <a href="http://www.earthclassmail.com/">Earth Class Mail</a> they can route email to the right person without maintaining and staffing a physical office space.</p>
<p>On the personal side, it would be awesome to never see another pile of mail on my kitchen table; however, the kitchen table eventually will always get cleared off whereas my inbox just scrolls awayâ€¦.</p>
<p>This seems like a great solution for small businesses, where there is no need for a physical office when you are just starting up.</p>
