Ok, I haven’t raved about my iPhone yet, because, aside from the awesome [cinematic interface](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000352.html), my favorite feature has been that I can listen to my voice mail in any order with a graphical UI, which is, frankly, not so remarkable…. but today I read about a remarkable app from [SnapTell](http://www.snaptell.com/) which made me feel like I’m living in the future….

[Alan Levine has detailed the SnapTell experience](http://cogdogblog.com/2008/10/19/mobile-magic/) (via blog [comment](http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/printing-out-online-course-materials-with-embedded-movie-links/#comment-450)). With my iPhone I took a photo of 3 random books on my side table and they were quickly cataloged with wikipedia references and google searches.

This seems way cooler than [QR tagging](http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2008/10/25/printing-out-online-course-materials-with-embedded-movie-links/) which seems to be [popular in Japan](http://flickr.com/search/?w=37996646802%40N01&q=qr+code+japan&m=text). Why create a weird looking block code? Why not just snap a photo of a company logo or storefront to find a webpage?
