<h1>NNDB maps relationships between the famous</h1>

<p><a href="http://mapper.nndb.com/">NNDB</a> (via <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2008/05/personal_profile_network_graphs.html">information aesthetics</a>) calls itself an “intelligence aggregator” tracking activities and relationships of over 32,000 notable people, both living and dead. The database includes a wide range of people from government, corporate boards, television, sports teams, and other organizations. <a href="http://mapper.nndb.com/">NNDB Mapper</a> is an intriguing visualization tool for illustrating relationships between people. You can also see how organizations might be aligned where people within those groups have connections, multiple roles or historical context.<br>

When first looking at it, I found it hard to see interesting patterns merely by browsing, but they provide a <a href="http://mapper.nndb.com/pr.html">nice video</a> which explains their techniques for setting up a good map and pruning out the irrelevant parts. I still find that you need to come to this kind of site with a question you would like to answer. There are stories behind the data.</p>
<p>It would be cool if this site offered APIs so that the data would be accessible from other projects.</p>
