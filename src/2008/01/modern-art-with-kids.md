We went to the SFMOMA yesterdays — 4 kids, 2 grown-ups — to see an awesome exhibit by Icelandic artist [Olafur Eliasson](http://www.olafureliasson.net). It’s great to see with kids — lots of art that you can walk through with spaces created from mirrors and light. My favorite is a tunnel across the top of the museum, pictured below. Fun advice from my friend who took us there is to go up the elevator and close your eyes before you walk onto the fifth floor exhibit.

On the way up, we saw a series of black paintings. One of the boys asked, “Where are all the employees of the month?”
