Now it is easy to “steal this widget,” just click on those words in the OMPL viewer on the right side of this page and you can fill out a web form to get one for your own web site (or [click here](http://www.mylaszlo.com/cgi-bin/blogbox)).

By storing settings in a database the verbose embed/object tag can be reduced to a single relatively short script tag. With a little help from my friends, we put together a simple service to experiment with a viral adoption modes. [Lyndon Wong](http://lyndonwong.blogspot.com/) wrote up some html pages, Yossie Silverman whipped up a perl script, and [Mark Davis](http://drdreff.blogspot.com) updated the Laszlo application.

Is a hierarchical list of links compelling enough to instigate viral adoption? Are there more folks like [Andrew Wooldridge](http://cogworks.manilasites.com) who would want to put this on their sites, but didn’t want to dig through html-view-source to figure it out? I guess we’ll see :)

Special thanks to [Laszlo Systems](http://www.laszlosystems.com) for hosting and encouraging this experiment. You don’t even have to work there to do this kind of thing. Any one can post to [mylaszlo](http://www.mylaszlo.com) and publish their own applications.
