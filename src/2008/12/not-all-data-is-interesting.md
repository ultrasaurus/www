Mathematician Martin Wattenberg [interview by boston.com](http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2008/12/29/he_creates_ways_of_seeing_information/) about his exhibit at the Boston Museum of Modern art. (via [ACM TechNews](http://technews.acm.org/archives.cfm?fo=2008-12-dec/dec-31-2008.html#393051))

“The traditional approach to visualization in science and business is to create something transparent and neutral – a telescope with clear glass,” he said as he roamed through the ICA exhibit. “But for an emotional approach, or an artistic approach, you want to bring a point of view. Not all data is interesting. The art is pointing the telescope at the right set of data.”

You can see his work online at [bewitched.com](bewitched.com). I had seen [Market Map](http://bewitched.com/marketmap.html), [Name Voyager](http://bewitched.com/namevoyager.html), and others before, but [History Flow](http://bewitched.com/historyflow.html) was new to me which visualized the editing history of wikipedia articles:
