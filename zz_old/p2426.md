> It’s easy to get frustrated when your program has errors. I try not to think of them as errors, though. I try to think of them as the pathetic attempts of a socially inept non-native English speaker (your computer) asking for help. If only your computer were a bit more cultured, it might say something more like, “Excuse me, but I’m unclear as to just one small point…did you want me to convert the integer to a string here, or vice versa? Although it’s probably obvious to any human what you are trying to do. I’m just not that bright.” Then it would laugh nervously.
