That’s why I personally believe in a three-pronged approach to achieving gender equality. Prong No 1: What we’re all doing — women helping women, supporting each other, inspiring each other, networking, cross-promoting, urging each other on. I am all about Madeleine Albright’s great quote: ‘There is a special place reserved in hell for women who do not help other women.’

1. Women need to help other women: support, inspire, network, cross-promote
2. We need men as our allies: share stories, call out inappropriate behavior, acknowledge the good guys
3. Spread awareness of issues in ways that increase recognition and understanding, in ways that are engaging, entertaining and compelling

Prong No 2: We change nothing for us as women unless we get to the men. Talking to ourselves, preaching to the choir — useless. We have to target and tackle men, and bring them round to seeing what the issues are and how they themselves can benefit by helping us.
