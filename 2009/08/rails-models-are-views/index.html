<h1>rails models are views?</h1>

<p><em>September 01, 2009</em></p>


<p>Rails appears pretty strict about separation of the abstraction layers that make up its notion of a web application: models, view and controllers. If you were to suggest calling a presentation method, such as url_for, in your model, the stoic Rails advocate will have an allergic reaction. However, Rails thinks nothing of rendering a model directly as a view, such as:</p>
<pre><code>
format.json { render :json =&gt; @products }
</code></pre>
<p>Now, one might argue that this is controller code and the controller is allowed to interpret the model as a view. The controller’s job is to mediate this interaction. However, I feel that it is a dangerous shortcut, made even more so by how hard to seems to be to override. Perhaps the json implementation is simply incomplete.</p>
<p>In xml, this strange controller pattern is easily corrected by <a href="http://danengle.us/2009/05/generating-custom-xml-for-your-rails-app/">providing an xml view</a>. The xml builder syntax is particularly readable, and it is easy to design your XML API effectively.</p>
<p>I haven’t found an equivalent for json. I tried to use a JSON API today to no avail. My model included image data which breaks when auto-rendered in JSON. What I really wanted was to include a URL instead of the image data, which I implement neatly in my xml.builder view:</p>
<pre><code>
xml.instruct!
xml.products(&quot;type&quot;=&gt;&quot;array&quot;) do
  @products.each do |product|
    xml.product do
      xml.sku product.sku
      xml.name product.name
      xml.brand product.brand
      xml.img_url url_for(:controller =&gt; :products, :action =&gt; :show, :format=&gt;:png, :id =&gt; product.id, :only_path =&gt; false)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that I want a similar view in JSON. The to_json API leads me to put this logic in my model (gasp!). In fact, the ActiveRecord::Serialization docs give an example of providing a method to generate JSON instead of a literal attribute. The example is of a “permalink” which seem suspiciously like something that belongs is the view layer.</p>
<pre><code>
  konata.to_json(:methods =&gt; :permalink)
  # =&gt; {&quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Konata Izumi&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 16,
        &quot;created_at&quot;: &quot;2006/08/01&quot;, &quot;awesome&quot;: true,
        &quot;permalink&quot;: &quot;1-konata-izumi&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>Today’s solution was to go back to using my comfortable old XML API, but I would prefer to consume JSON from the other side. I wonder if anyone is working on a JSON builder or if there is some clear solution that I haven’t yet stumbled upon.</p>
