I heard about *codevember* from a friend at work: a challenge to write code every day. While waiting for npm modules to install and whatnot, I found this description via [@codevember\_](https://twitter.com/codevember_):  
 Codevember is a challenge for developers making a creative sketch by day during the whole month of November.

I was curious how this came about. I love the idea of sketching in code. I first heard of that concept from Rob Read, who I worked with at 18F. He used to say that we should make prototypes like the designers made sketches on paper. A code sketch explores an idea, maybe communicates something. We should expect to throw it a way, or the digital equivalent of posting it on the wall â€” maybe leaving it running for a while so people can play with it and remember.
