[![](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/gliffy.jpg)](http://www.gliffy.com)[Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com) is a great new tool for creating diagrams. It recently opened up it’s doors to a public beta. I’ve been using it for a while. It’s awesome to be able to create a quick network diagram, and then publish it to get a easily accessible jpeg image. I’ve never loved Visio, and now I don’t need it anymore! Working on a team with that uses both Mac and Windows there just hasn’t been a good way to create a diagram that can be easily edited by anyone on the team before Gliffy.

They’ve got some other neat features that make it feel like a mature product that can easily fit into your workflow:  
– collaborative tools  
– version control  
– SVG export

Also, in addition to the basic shapes that I’ve been using during the private beta, they just introduced:  
– Flowchart  
– UI wireframes  
– Floor plan  
– Network shapes (yay!)

Gliffy is built using [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org) by Chris Kohlhardt and Clint Dickson. The interface is snappy and easy to learn. It includes the kind of important user interface details you’ve come to expect from a desktop app: the side palettes can be quickly tucked away, allowing more room for your drawing; when the browser resizes, the document and tools resize fluidly; and you’ll find familiar menus and toolbars. You’ll forget you are using a web browser!
