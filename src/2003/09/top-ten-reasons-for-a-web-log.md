For a while I’ve been thinking about why I enjoy blogging. The reasons I created this weblog remain, but I’ve discovered more and different reasons over time. My approach has changed substantially since my second posting posed the question: [Are blogs the vanity press of the Internet?](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/2003_03.html)

Since I’ve read and enjoyed many blogger top ten lists, I plan to write this list as a series of posts. As I write them, I’ll link them back from here for future reference. In chronological order:

\#1: [participatory geekiness](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000064.html)  
\#2: [gender issues](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000067.html)  
\#3: [giving back](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000082.html)  
\#4: [reverse search engine](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000081.html)  
\#5: thinking practice: [language is the vehicle of thought](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000086.html)  
\#6: [marking the passage of time](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000101.html)  
\#7: writing practice: [just do it](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000122.html)  
\#8: finding my voice: [just do it](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000348.html)
