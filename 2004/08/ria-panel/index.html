<h1>RIA panel</h1>

<p>Bay CHI is putting on a very interesting panel this week: <a href="http://www.baychi.org/program/">Reading the Technology Tea Leaves: Is a Rich Internet Application in Your Future?</a></p>
<p>The panel will feature speakers representing a range of RIA tech: Laszlo (of course), Macromedia (who coined the term “RIA”) and a couple of DHTML wizards from Oddpost.</p>
<p>I expect it to be an interesting evening — don’t miss it!</p>
