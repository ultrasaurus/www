<h1>Laszlo Mugs</h1>

<p>We recently wrapped up version 2.0 of the Laszlo Presentation Server. In celebration of the new components, I opened a couple of <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">Cafe Press</a> stores to special-order some custom Laszlo schwag. It was a fun excuse to check out Cafe Press. Its an amazing business where you can create your own T-shirts, mugs or whatever with custom graphics. The site is very easy to use and I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>So… the stores are open and mugs are sold at cost. I’m posting links here for Laszlovians, Laszlo developers and other fans.</p>

<p>Art and words by Peter Andrea. I’m not sure that he inteded the words to be immortalized in ceramic. Created originally in a test file, we enjoyed them so much that they travelled into an example file.</p>
<p>Mug graphic preparations by Dan Lewis. Tabs by Christian Walker and Pablo Kang. Checkbox and radio buttons by me. Font by <a href="http://www.truthindesign.com/">Truth in Design</a> with insane amounts of detail work by Chris Lowrey and Peter Andrea.</p>
