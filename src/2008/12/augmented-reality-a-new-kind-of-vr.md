[Papervision Augmented Reality](http://interactive.digitalpictures.com.au/?p=392) (via [OUseful](http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/steps-towards-making-augmented-reality-a-reality/))

By printing a little square pattern, using my webcam, I got this little creature to appear on my desk:

It was a little fragile — I couldn’t get it to appear reliably and it disappeared when I moved it.

I can’t wait to try out the native code apps for the iPhone (lots of cool links at [OUseful](http://ouseful.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/steps-towards-making-augmented-reality-a-reality/))… reminds me of the VR-GPS art installations in [Spook Country](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FWXR66?ie=UTF8&tag=ultrasaurus-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001FWXR66) by William Gibson which I just started reading.
