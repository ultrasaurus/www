[Yo-Yo Ma talks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoGUdPsOM2M) about the edge effect. Where two ecosystems meet we see the most diversity of life — this is innovation in biology. We see the same patterns at work in other domains — music, winemakers. He asks “What are the preconditions of creativity?” diversity creates a breeding ground…

> **where does disruptive innovation happen?** It doesn’t happen in the big planned R&amp;D labs; it happens on the edges of the network — Joichi Ito

The Internet is an example of distributed decentralized innovation, “a kind of working anarchy.” He describes it as  
“the triumph of distributed innovation over centralized innovation…a triumph of chaos over control.”

“a lot of the greatest innovations that we see today are things that wouldn’t have gotten approval”
