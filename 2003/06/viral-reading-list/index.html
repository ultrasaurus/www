<h1>viral reading list</h1>

<p>“I know you don’t write, but do you read?” my grandmother once asked me. These days I find myself reading several books at once. <a href="http://www.allconsuming.net/">All Consuming</a> has created a nify gutter snippet that lets me keep track of and publish my reading list.</p>
<p>Reading lists should be viral. The blogging trend has created fertile ground for a number of sites that help people publish lists. I noticed this one on <a href="http://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/">mamamusings</a>. I like its layout — all I need to do is type in the title and my comments, then it finds pictures, authors and links.</p>
