Jon Udell [writes about visual numeracy](http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/11/18/visual-numeracy-for-collective-survival/), introducing a new graph to continue the [conversation](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000507.html) about where the [US gets its oil](http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/11/09/where-the-oil-comes-from-not-from-where-i-thought/).

Here’s his original map of US oil imports by region:

Here’s his latest graph about where the global oil reserves are:

Comments on Udell’s [latest post](http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/11/18/visual-numeracy-for-collective-survival/) point out that this kind of graph is called a [cartogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartogram), which is a map where areas are scaled to indicate the scalar value of the statistic that is being displayed on the map.

My favorite (via [Tony Hirst](http://ouseful.wordpress.com/)) is from a series on [2008 election results](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/):

Popular vote results displayed on a map of the US.

Update: further reading in the comments reveals an interesting insight by [Tim](http://www.librarything.com/):

> “The thing that irritates me about the first visualization is that by visualizing some data you imply that the data is important. But visualizations, like statistics can lie.
> 
> ‘In fact, where the US gets its oil is almost completely irrelevant. The oil market is a world market. The transportation costs are startlingly small but-all things being equal-it’s easier to get oil from countries that are near you (and hard to get it from countries you don’t trade with).
> 
> “The ‘dangerous disconnect’ between American perception–the US is dependent on Middle Eastern oil–and the reality–we get a lot of our oil from Canada–is actually misunderstanding that is \*healthier\* than the misunderstanding the chart might lead one to take.
> 
> “Reading the chart one might imagine that, if the Middle East were plunged into a giant multi-state war, we’d be basically fine. Of course, unless the United States invaded Canada-and Africa, yay!-and commandeered all the oil for US consumption, we’d be in the grip of massive undersupply and a resulting rise in the price of oil.  
> It’s also worth saying that reserve numbers have all sorts of spin on them…

Personally, I think the graphs help illustrate the conversation. Your mind doesn’t have to do a double-step between a list of numbers and the narrative that discusses them. Graphing statistics helps tell a story, but as Tim says it is only part of the story. We need to fill in the causal effects and the consequence, and in doing so, draw conclusions and learn.
