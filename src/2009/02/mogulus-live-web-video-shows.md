I had heard recently about [mogulus](http://www.mogulus.com/) which allows people to create their own live web video shows ([crunchbase overview](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mogulus)). I spent some time this morning wading through the interface to try creating a show. My test show on the “foobar” channel is about pie, featuring my son’s favorite pie videos.
