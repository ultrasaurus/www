X10 Wireless Technology, Inc. one of the first aggressive internet marketers well known for its use of “pop-under ads” — In Nov 2001, an informal study conculed that “x10 camera ‘pop-under’ adverts now account for 89% of bandwidth used by all broadband users.” (DSLreports)

although x10.com’s prolific pop-under ad campaign reached 32% of web users, 4.2% of whom clicked through, analyst marissa gluck from jupiter media metrix stated that, “the number of transactions was so low as to be statistically insignificant.” going further, she then stated, “because the ads are everywhere, they have become irrelevant. further, it is not an offer consumers care about and that’s why they have become so annoying.”
