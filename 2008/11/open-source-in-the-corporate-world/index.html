<h1>open source in the corporate world</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/">Ted Leung</a> reflects on <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=57">open source and the corporate world</a> in an interview on <a href="http://herdingcode.com/">herding code</a>. It is a bit long for the typical web attention span (over an hour), but worth listening to.</p>
<p>Notes…<br>
* Companies benefits by releasing something that they know people want/need.<br>
* Developers want access to be able to do something collaboratively with the product, to contribute code so that the next version will have the feature or bug fix they need.<br>
* In open source, intelligence is distributed, so it is harder to kill<br>
* Let people decide what they like, economic benefits accrue to the popular<br>
* Ted wants to see as large a substrate for innovation as possible and sees open source as a way to do that<br>
* We’re not there yet… people who are good at blogging cause their projects to be more widely adopted, which doesn’t necessarily cause the best stuff to win</p>
