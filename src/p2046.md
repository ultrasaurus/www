I think UTF8 is lovely. Thank goodness all the web tech I know standardized on it years ago. Aside from wide adoption, UTF8 is nice because plain old ascii always fits in a byte and has the same numerical values for each character in UTF8 and ascii. Then more complex, language specific characters are more bytes. For example, the latin á is two bytes, the Japanese ち is three bytes, the Linear B ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Linear_B_Ideogram_B102_Woman.svg/40px-Linear_B_Ideogram_B102_Woman.svg.png) would be 4 bytes (I include it as an image, since I don’t have that font on my machine and I would guess that you don’t either).
