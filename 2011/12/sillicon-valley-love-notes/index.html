<h1>sillicon valley love notes</h1>

<p>We need more pop culture that show how strong men can be attracted to powerful, smart, technical women. A couple of years ago, I wrote about the rise in <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/08/hacker-love-songs/">hacker love songs</a> being a positive trend for women in computing. Today I saw <a href="http://siliconvalleyryangosling.tumblr.com/">Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t count the number of times my sweetheart stayed up late with me and edited yet one more draft of an important proposal or word-smithed my bio to make me sound more impressive than I thought I was. We need new media portrayals of what it means to be loved in an honest and meaningful way.</p>
<p>While I wish it had been a guy, writing love notes for a girl, <a href="http://siliconvalleyryangosling.tumblr.com/">Silicon Valley Ryan Gosling</a> was created by writer, artist and designer, <a href="http://lianamaris.com/">Lian Amaris</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/lianamaris">@lianamaris</a>).</p>
<p>I think Angie Chang said it well in <a href="http://www.women2.org/ryan-gosling-wants-you-to-raise-capital-to-grow-your-startup/">her post on Ryan Gosling Silicon Valley</a>:</p>
