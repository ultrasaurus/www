<h1>obama Ms. magazine cover</h1>

<p>I think the cover of the Ms. Winter Issue is fantastic. I can’t believe some so-called feminists think that it somehow diminishes women for a man to declare himself a feminist.. or maybe they just don’t have a sense of humor… or both.</p>
<p>As the story goes, when the chair of the Feminist Majority Foundation board, Peg Yorkin, and <span class="byline">Eleanor Smeal, publisher of Ms. magazine,</span> met Barack Obama, he immediately offered “I am a feminist.” They claim that he ran on the strongest platform for women’s rights of any major party in American history. I would have hoped that Hillary’s platform would have been better, but I don’t doubt the claim.</p>
