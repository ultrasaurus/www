New systems of financial exchange are emerging fueled by a cryptographically-enabled network commons. Ten years after Satoshi proposed a solution to the “double-spending problem” using a peer-to-peer network, in his influential paper, [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf), I can find a [digital wallet](https://www.cryptocompare.com/wallets/#/overview) that supports hundreds of different cryptocurrencies. What’s up with that?

Most cryptocurrency, like the original Bitcoin, is not tied to anything of intrinsic value, which make it a kind of *fiat* currency. This *soft* money category includes most of Bitcoin’s fast followers and “hard forks,” such as Litecoin/LTC, Ethereum/ETH, Ripple/XRP, IOTA/MIOTA, Darkcoin/Dash (via [Top Cryptocurrencies 2015 – 2018  ](https://cryptocurrencyfacts.com/list-of-cryptocurrencies/)).

A new class of cryptocurrency is emerging that is perhaps the most natural virtual currency. Just one step removed from barter, companies are tying “mining” activities to the actual value represented by the coin:

<table><thead><tr><th>Company/Currency</th><th>Commodity</th><th>“marketcap”</th><th>ICO news</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Filecoin</td><td>Cloud Storage</td><td></td><td>[Aug ’17](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/filecoins-ico-opens-today-for-accredited-investors-after-raising-52m-from-advisers/)</td></tr><tr><td>Livepeer</td><td>Video Transcoding</td><td>[LPT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/livepeer/)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Brave’s Basic Attention Token</td><td>Advertising</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Note: there are also cryptocurrencies that track real-world commodities  
In 2018, [Digix](https://digix.global/) released DGX where each coin represents 1 gram of Gold. Transactions use the [Etherium Smart Contracts](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper), a Turing Complete scripting language to encode arbitrary state transition functions that can transfer cryptocurrency with conditional controls, and the gold is stored in a giant vault in Singapore (vai [Invest In Blockchain: What is DigixDAO?](https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-digixdao/)).

\* Sparkz – price of energy: If you generate excess electricity, you can use Sparkz to sell it to your neighbors who might need it.  
(Inactive – Petro intended to be backed by Venezuela’s reserves of oil)

- Tether – backed by USD with 1-1 value ratio?
