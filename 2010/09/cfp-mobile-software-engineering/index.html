<h1>CFP: mobile software engineering</h1>

<p>Is there anything special about mobile software development or is it the equivalent to developing for a very small laptop? Do the devices and capabilities imply different patterns and processes? Are there any implications for research and education?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/wmse/">Workshop on Mobile Software Engineering</a> in conjunction with MobiCASE 2010 will be exploring these questions. Martin Griss and Ray Bareiss from Carnegie Mellon are chairing the workshop. Iâ€™m on the organizing committee and look forward to hearing from other people in the field. At time I think the answers are obvious, but then find that other people come to different conclusions. It is sure to be an interesting conversation.</p>
<p>The call for papers has been extended till Sept 28 to invite additional participation. <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/wmse/">Please join us</a>.</p>
