Oliver Steele has added an interactive booklist to his [blog](http://www.osteele.com/) (scroll all the way to the bottom on the left). He has a wonderful [description](http://www.osteele.com/archives/2003/10/laszlo_booklist_application.html) of how it was developed — only 42 lines of code, written in [Laszlo](http://www.laszlosystems.com/). It’s pretty nifty, and especially useful for a long booklist.

Its neat to see this kind of leight-weight user interface in a rich internet application. Immersive experiences are great, but its also good to remember that we can add fluid and elegant user experence to augment an HTML page. I like Oliver’s approach of blending the background of the app seemlessly in the web page.
