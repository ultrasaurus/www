It’s been over three weeks and there’s been no sign of Jerry since the first few days. A dedicated group of friends and family continue to search and spread the word. The more people who are looking out for Jerry, the greater chance we’ll find him.

I’ve been reluctant to update my weblog with other entries. Everything I’ve thought to write seemed too trivial to replace the previous post. I think Jerry would hardly have expected such an outpouring of love and support. I hadn’t even seen him much in the last year or so, since we weren’t working together day-to-day, but I didn’t expect \*not\* to see him.

So… I plan to go ahead with my mundane writings in this weblog, but I’ve created a little app to show a slideshow of pictures of Jerry at the top right of the page with links to all the relevant info. So, perhaps my readers will keep an eye out and someone will see him and help him find his way home.

And if anyone else want to put the same app on your website, just include the following html:

&lt;object type=”application/x-shockwave-flash” data=”https://www.ultrasaurus.com/findjerry/miniSlideshow.lzx.swf” width=”180″ height=”460″&gt;  
&lt;param name=”movie” value=”https://www.ultrasaurus.com/findjerry/miniSlideshow.lzx.swf”&gt;  
&lt;param name=”quality” value=”high”&gt;  
&lt;param name=”scale” value=”noscale”&gt;  
&lt;param name=”salign” value=”LT”&gt;  
&lt;param name=”menu” value=”false”&gt;&lt;/object&gt;

\[update: I forgot to mention that this is, of course, built with [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org) and the source code is [here](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/findjerry/findjerry.zip). Many thanks to [Lyndon Wong](http://lyndonwong.blogspot.com/) who wrote a [mini-slideshow](http://lyndolab.blogspot.com/) and posted the source on [mylaszlo](http://www.mylaszlo.com/browse.php?page=5&order=user).
