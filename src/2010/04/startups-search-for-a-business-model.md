Steve Blank is probably most well known for this picture about embracing change:

Observations about Silicon Valley:

- $500K is the new $5M
- Seed Funds are providing entrepreneurial education
- Customer Development / Lean Startup adoption: We are all collectively getting smarter at a scary rate.

99.7% of all companies are &lt;500 employees and employ half of the people in the country. In contrast, a scalable startup is designed to grow big and it typically needs risk capital. (Note: venture capital was originally called “adventure capital.”)

Your job as an entrepreneur is to search for a scalable and repeatable business model. Then build a business around it. Founders depart before the company grows to a large business:

1. Search
2. Build
3. Grow

No business plan survives contact with customers.

Startups search and pivot. Small and large companies execute.

Startups should focus on:

- metrics, not accounting.
- customer validation, not sales.
- customer development, not product management.
- agile development, not engineering.

Lean startups use agile and customer development to find profits. (A high percentage of company founders come from dysfunctional families, but that’s another topic.)
