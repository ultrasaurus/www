Announced last week, Adobe has won a Technical and Engineering Emmy® Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for its Flash® Video technology, in recognition of the software’s pivotal role in bringing television content to the Internet. (via [yahoo](http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/061102/20061102005910.html?.v=1))

While I’m pleased to have played a key role in developing such award-winning software, when we developed the Flash Media Server (the Flash Communication Server) and added two-way audio-video to Flash, I had hoped that more sites would take advantage of its collaborative aspects. Nonetheless, I was unsurprised when Flash became the de-facto standard for video on the web. It was a challenge to find a/v codecs that fit into the small code size footprint that we were targeting… less than 100K for compression and decompression of video and voice and the streaming protocol code.
