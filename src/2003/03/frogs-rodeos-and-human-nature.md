The myth was debunked in 1995, but I first read it this morning. I found it heartening to read [this story about the old frog-boiling myth](http://www.fastcompany.com/online/01/frog.html).

I was was tipped off by “the unknown Flash Guy” who tells [a story about a rodeo](http://www.crinklink.com/Rodeo.htm), which itself could be a parable of human nature, if it weren’t also true.
