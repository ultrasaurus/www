<h1>r: functions and avoiding loops</h1>

<p>After <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/2012/10/getting-started-with-r/">getting started</a> with the basic syntax and some frequently used functions, I needed to learn to write some code.</p>
<p>I enjoyed this nice <a href="http://www.statmethods.net/management/userfunctions.html">intro to functions</a>.</p>
<pre><code>
myfunction &lt;- function(arg1, arg2, ... ) {
   statements
   return(object)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can put functions (or any code) in a text file and load it from the R command line:</p>
<pre><code>
source(&quot;mycode.R&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>where mycode.R is in the same directory as where I’m running R or a full path to the script.</p>
<p>But then I got stuck in how to transform my data table. As much as I wanted to iterate using loops, I felt that was a very un-R-like solution. I found some good patterns in <a href="https://twitter.com/xieyihui">@xieyihui</a>‘s <a href="http://yihui.name/en/2010/10/on-the-gory-loops-in-r/">gory loops</a> post.</p>
<p>If you need to make a string, you can use <code>paste</code> like Ruby’s join method:</p>
<pre><code>
&gt; words  words
[1] &quot;one&quot;   &quot;two&quot;   &quot;three&quot;

&gt; paste(words)
[1] &quot;one&quot;   &quot;two&quot;   &quot;three&quot;

&gt; paste(words, collapse=&quot;&quot;)
[1] &quot;onetwothree&quot;

&gt; paste(words, collapse=&quot;,&quot;)
[1] &quot;one,two,three&quot;

&gt; paste(words, collapse=&quot;, &quot;)
[1] &quot;one, two, three&quot;
</code></pre>
