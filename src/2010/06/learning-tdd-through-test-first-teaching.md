In April, I spoke at the [East Bay Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/EBRuby/calendar/12145157/?eventId=12145157&action=detail) about Test-First Teaching both as a teaching methodology and as a path to learning about test-driven development.

Marakana kindly sponsored the recording of the talk. Max Walker did the video recording, production and and just [posted it](http://marakana.com/forums/ruby/ruby_on_rails/134.html):

Another [Ruby on Rails training](http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html?a=sarah) at Marakana is coming up July 19-23, sign up before June 19th to get the early bird discount.
