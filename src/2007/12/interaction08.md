If you haven’t yet signed up for [Interaction08](http://interaction08.ixda.org/index.php), space is filling up so sign up quick!

This is the first annual [IxDA](http://www.ixda.org/) conference and I’m honored to be one of the speakers. It’s an amazing group of presenters, including keynotes by Alan Cooper, Bill Buxton, Sigi Moeslinger and Malcolm McCullough. Read more about IxDA and the conference in an [interview with Dan Saffer](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/interactions-08-in) on Boxes &amp; Arrows.

They also have a pretty [cool social networking site](http://interaction08.crowdvine.com/) by [crowdvine](http://www.crowdvine.com/) set up for the conference — if you are going, please connect with [me](http://interaction08.crowdvine.com/profiles/7907) on that site so we can meet up at the conference.
