This [wonderful color scheme selector](http://www.pixy.cz/apps/barvy/index-en.html) (and [more reading on color](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/natural_selections_colors_found_in_nature_and_interface_design.php)  
via [Usable Design Media](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vgondi/2003/10/16#a510)) got me thinking more about color. This neat app also has options to see the color scheme with variations of color blindness. You can preview your own website using this [colorblind filter](http://colorfilter.wickline.org/) (via [the other blog](http://dev11.otherworks.com/theotherblog/)).

There must be hundreds of color pickers on the web, [Nathan Steiner reviews](http://web-graphics.com/mtarchive/000972.php) 36 of them. Bob Stein who created [VisiBone ColorLab](http://www.visibone.com/colorlab/) and other nitfy tools says “I believe complexity is best mastered by seeing the whole picture in rich detail; that expertise consists mainly of vivid mental pictures.”

It certainly helps me to have brilliant living images in my minds eye, which I aspire to make real in software or other designs. When I was writing 3D computer software in college and designing complex scenes and animation in pure text, I acquired the peculiar skill of visualizing light, saturation and hue from seemingly random alphanumeric series. This ability has been continuously useful as I drifted through user interface design, video compositing and special effects, alpha channel rendering, multimedia and web applications. If someone had asked me, I might have said that by the time the new millennium rolled around I wouldn’t be needing to remember this odd mapping from what I expect to see to RGB. I’m particularly fond of ddddff.
