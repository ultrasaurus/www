I am excited to be teaching a Ruby on Rails class at Marakana in San Francisco on Nov 16-19th. I’ve come to feel that the 1 day workshops just give participants a taste of the technology and a quick peek at the power of Ruby on Rails. After working on the course materials, I still feel that 4-days is a short time, but I am excited to have the opportunity to spend that much focused time teaching a group of students in a small, hands-on class. If you have a need to learn Ruby on Rails, please [sign up](http://marakana.com/training/ruby/ruby_on_rails.html?a=sarah).

Note: this class has been given many times before at Marakana, so the testimonials are for previous classes with another instructor. I’ll be bringing in some fresh ideas from my teaching experience, but I’ll also be leveraging Marakana’s experience of what has worked well in the past.

For some, this is a high priced training. You are paying for a great training facilities, class materials and an experienced instructor. In terms of value delivered, I expect that to be well worth it and I hope my students will feel that to be true when they finish the class. However, I know there are a lot of people who cannot afford such a class who could really benefit from it. If you read this blog, you know that I do a lot of volunteer work in outreach to women with the [Free SFRuby Rails Workshops](http://sfrubyworkshops.com/). I feel strongly that we all need to do what we can to make our community what we want it to be. I’d like it to be diverse in terms of age, race, class, gender and any other aspect of the general population. I am thrilled that Marakana feels the same way and we have agreed to offer full or partial scholarships for one or two students in the class.

**Scholarships available**  
If you feel that your presence will increase diversity in the Ruby on Rails community and that taking this class could have a positive impact on your life and you would not otherwise be able to afford the class, please fill out [this short form](http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEdpay16SEJ0dWF4UUhFYUdvc1NDemc6MA). Our decision on the candidate will balance your need, how much taking this course will have a beneficial effect and your potential impact on the community. Bonus points for bloggers and twitterers or people who otherwise spread their know-how.

Special thanks to [Marko Gargenta](http://marakana.com/) and [Anna Billstrom](http://www.banane.com/) for helping to make the scholarships happen.
