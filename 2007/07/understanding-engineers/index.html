<h1>understanding engineers</h1>

<p><a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2007/07/17/understanding_engineers_feasibility">Charles Miller describes</a> how engineers express the level of difficulty of solving a problem (via <a href="http://blog.eronj.com/2007/07/18/charles-miller-understanding-engineers-feasibility/">Ron K. Jeffries</a>). He has some great descriptions of each level of difficulty, which I found quite accurate:</p>
<p>* Impossible<br>
* Unfeasable<br>
* Non-Trivial<br>
* Very Hard<br>
* Hard<br>
* Trivial</p>
<p>I’ve added “straightforward” to my language, which describes trivial problems that will still require some time to implement. I find it helpful in talking to non-engineers and to other engineers who might argue with my characterization of a given problem as “trivial.”</p>
