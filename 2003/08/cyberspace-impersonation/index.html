<h1>cyberspace impersonation</h1>

<p>Peldi has <a href="http://www.peldi.com/blog/000027.html">enountered an impersonator</a>. I had wondered whether the addition of video communication with Flash would reduce this kind of on-line mischief. By the way, I don’t think it is off-topic at all.</p>
<p>I suppose that if you don’t know what Peldi looks like or don’t know his personality, you might be taken in. <a href="http://viswanathgondi.blogspot.com/2003_07_27_viswanathgondi_archive.html#105960133689380545">Viswanath Gondi</a> notes: “We all will soon evolve into learning not to believe every thing we see and hear. We will learn to fit what we hear by comparing it to their personalities.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.markme.com/jd/archives/002981.cfm">Nobody knows you’re a dog </a>observes JD, linking also to a wonderful article that he wrote with some sage advice on <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/jd_forum/jd030.html">debugging net rumors</a>.</p>
<p>Reading these articles this morning reminded me of Julian Dibbell’s article, <a href="http://www.juliandibbell.com/texts/bungle_vv.html">A Rape in Cyberspace</a>: How an Evil Clown, a Haitian Trickster Spirit, Two Wizards, and a Cast of Dozens Turned a Database Into a Society. I believe there is a significant difference between manipulating psudeonyms in virtual worlds and impersonating real life identity; however, I enjoyed re-reading this thought-provoking tale.</p>
