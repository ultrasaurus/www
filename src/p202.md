So, after spending some time one weekend optimizing, I came into the office and said gleefully: “Optimization is fun!” A few of my colleagues looked at me sideways. It struck me that I haven’t always thought that optimization was fun. In fact, I used to feel sorry for the engineer on the team who was tasked with optimization.
