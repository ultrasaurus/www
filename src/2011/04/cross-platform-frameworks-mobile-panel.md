I’m excited to be moderating a [WCA Mobile SIG panel](http://www.wca.org/) on May 10th in San Jose. On the panel will be leaders of the top cross-platform mobile frameworks, [Rhomobile](http://rhomobile.com/) (Rhodes), [Nitobi](http://www.nitobi.com/) ([PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/)) and [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/) (Titanium) along with the relative newcomer [AppMakr](http://www.appmakr.com/).

Walk-Ins are welcome if there’s space, but I would advise reserving your spot ahead of time — [sign up here](http://www.wca.org/).

Speakers:

- Adam Blum, CEO, [Rhomobile](http://rhomobile.com/)
- Andre Charland, CEO, [Nitobi](http://www.nitobi.com/)
- Jeff Haynie, CEO, [Appcelerator](http://www.appcelerator.com/)
- Sean Shadmand, CSO, [AppMakr](http://www.appmakr.com/)

I have my own ideas of what would be interesting questions for the panelists having completed a tour of cross-platform frameworks when researching [my book](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Smartphone-Cross-Platform-Development-Distribution/dp/1430228687/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1303007937&sr=1-1). I very interested in what questions other people have. Whether or not you are attending the panel, please let me know in a comment or send email to sarah at this domain and let me know your thoughts.
