<h1>more little rules for working life</h1>

<p><em>January 14, 2018</em></p>


<p>It helps me to create little rules that provide default decisions for common and unusual situations. A couple of years ago, I wrote down my <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/2013/09/little-rules-for-working-life/">little rules for working life</a>. Since then, I’ve collected a few more…</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speak the unspoken.</li>
<li>Have difficult conversations.</li>
<li>Find something remarkable, and remark on it, every day.</li>
<li>Not everything needs to be said.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decision-Making</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be intentional</strong>: for me, it takes reflection and constant conscious effort for my words and actions to reflect my values.</li>
<li><strong>Consider your influencers</strong> (the people who influence you), and choose them as intentionally as you can.</li>
<li><strong>Have a plan.</strong> Learn something. <strong>Change the plan.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Play the long game.</strong> Sometimes we have to do stuff that we don’t care about in the short-term, in order to meet expectations from people who decide if we get paid or if we get privileges. Even while we do the stupid short-term things, we can sometimes set ourselves up for some potentially awesome, or at least potentially meaningful future.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the outcome.</strong> Imagine what happens after you reach your goal. Then what? Often the real goal is the next thing, or the thing after that.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Unstuck</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you hit a wall, <strong>step back and learn.</strong> Learn more about the problem. Who else sees it as a problem? Who made this wall anyhow? It’s probably there for a reason and the problem might be an unintended consequence.</li>
<li><strong>Get to know the people.</strong> The system is made of people, and usually those aren’t the same people who made the system.</li>
<li><strong>Write stuff down.</strong> Sometimes what you think you heard wasn’t the same thing other people heard.</li>
<li><strong>Wait a week and ask again.</strong> Or a month. Or just listen for the moment when someone else raises the same problem, and chime in.</li>
</ul>
