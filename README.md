* Migrated from WordPress (previously from MoveableType)
* pre-migration (4/13/2021) - 60 broken links detected via [deadlinkchecker](https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/) -- save in [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sYxRjtbNwGNLc8RIhs-d9T5aVPmjjiniY5Qm1FtzI_g/edit#gid=0)

TODO

1. don't show draft posts (maybe put in a folder with diff tag? or omit from collections.blog with code)
1. do any posts not have title? (that aren't drafts)
1. fix errors (attachment folder thing)
1. don't forget to add back google analytics
1. push to github pages (or something)
1. check broken links -- did it get worse?

----
Could do these after switching DNS (if past WP shutdown date)
* what about "Code" category?
