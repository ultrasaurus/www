<h1>i love comic sans</h1>

<p>To say that comic sans is <a href="http://www.achewood.com/index.php?date=07052007">widely disliked</a> may be putting it mildly. However, I’m not afraid to say that I love comic sans. I have fond memories of it from Kindergarten. It is the only font I know that makes the letter “a” in the same way they teach us to write it.<br>
