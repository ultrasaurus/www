<h1>blogher</h1>

<p>I’m looking forward to going to <a href="http://www.blogher.org/">blogher</a> next week. I am honored to be selected as a <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/">six apart</a> scholar at Blogher. I liked the questions asked by six apart, so I’ve posted them below with my repsonse.</p>
<p>Who else is going to the conference? Wanna meet up? Anyone interested in carpooling from SF? (send me a <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/emailme.php">note</a> if you have room in your car)</p>
<p><strong>What</strong></p>
