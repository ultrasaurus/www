[Daivd Temkin](http://www.davidtemkin.com), CTO of Laszlo Systems, puts Laszlo in context following the Macromedia Flex announcement. He writes that Laszlo is XML technology, not Flash technology:

“We think the Web is on the verge of a sea change, with the dual drivers of broadband and Web services, and we see an XML-based framework for RIAs as essential to this transition.” ([read more](http://www.davidtemkin.com/mtarchive/000001.html))

Laszlo’s XML language and framework are a powerful way to create next generation web applications. SWF is a convenient output format, but Laszlo Presentation Server offers significant benefits over raw Flash. In fact, it offers significant benefits over any other method of developing an application user interface.
