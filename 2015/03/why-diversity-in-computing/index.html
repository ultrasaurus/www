<h1>why diversity in computing?</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-scorecard-report-status-women-information-technology">NCWIT Scorecard</a> has great statistics and references. While the report’s title is “Why is gender diversity important in computing?” much of the supporting research references different kinds of diversity. Here’s a high level snapshot:</p>
<h2>Diversity</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expands the Qualified Employee Pool</strong><br>
We’re not taking advantage of our diverse population. The industry is failing to attract<br>
this talent. Indeed, those women already employed in the technology industry are<br>
leaving at staggering rates, so we’re not retaining either.</li>
<li><strong>Improves the Bottom Line</strong><br>
Technology companies with the highest representation of<br>
women in their senior management teams showed a higher return on equity than did<br>
those with fewer or no women in senior management.</li>
<li><strong>Enhances Innovation</strong><br>
A large study spanning 21 different companies showed<br>
that teams with 50:50 gender membership were more experimental and more efficient.<br>
Extensive research has found that groups with greater diversity solve complex problems<br>
better and faster than do homogenous groups. Culturally diverse teams have been shown<br>
to generate a wider variety of possible strategies when setting a course of action.</li>
<li><strong>Promotes Equality</strong><br>
With technology playing an increasingly crucial role in all of our<br>
lives, having more people from different backgrounds participate in its creation can help<br>
break down gender and racial economic inequalities.</li>
<li><strong>Reflects the Customers</strong><br>
Most companies serve a variety of people, so it makes sense then to have a variety of intelligent, skilled people working on services and products.</li>
</ul>
