Not so often these days do I see something on the web that really makes me think. This thought-provoking presentation was originally written by [Karl Fisch](http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/), technology director for a high school, as a presentation for a faculty meeting. His original title was “[Did you know?](http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/2006/08/did-you-know.html)” Many thanks to [Rashmi ](http://www.rashmisinha.com)who highlighted the [roots of this presentation](http://www.rashmisinha.com/archives/07_05/shift%20happens.html) which won a recent [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net) contest.

You should watch the whole slideshow, but in case you don’t, here’s my favorite part: We are currently preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist… using technologies that haven’t been invented… in order to solve problems we don’t even know are problems yet.

We live in exponential times.
