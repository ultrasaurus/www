![](http://img.skitch.com/20090502-dsras4k8m4bgxinxii2yytp7ea.jpg)On the day after [GoGaRuco](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/golden-gate-ruby-conference/), I attended my first “[hack session](http://www.meetup.com/sfruby/calendar/10189361/).” Hosted by the awesome and generous Mark Carranza, it was great fun. About a dozen folks showed up with all levels of Ruby/Rails expertise represented.

My personal goal for the day was to learn about nested models in Rails 2.3. I’ve been slogging through old 2.0.2 code which will soon be upgraded to the latest and I’ve been looking forward to the new features.

Nested models is one of those features that I was surprised to hear wasn’t already in Rails. It seemed like one of those obviously needed things… although I think the use cases are more common in REST APIs than in HTML forms. I spent most of the day talking with folks and didn’t get so far on this project as to see how it all plays out in REST; however, I did get the basics working (thanks Austin!). The basic instructions are written up [elsewhere](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/2_3_release_notes.html), but I needed a few tips along the way, so I thought I would share all of the lovely details. I’ll write this tutorial-style, since that is what would have helped me most.

At a high-level, nested models allow you to interact with the controller for one model and have it control another model. This is especially valuable for create operations when you want the creation of the primary object and the related object to succeed or fail together, so you don’t end up with stray objects lying around in the failure case. As a simple example to learn about this concept, I decided to build yet another “to do” list app. The app would have projects which each have a list of tasks. The goal is to create a new project and its subtasks in one fell swoop.

1. Create basic app framework ```
  $ rails -d mysql nestedmodels
  $ cd nestedmodels
  $ rake db:create:all
  ```
2. Generate two models: Project &amp; Task ```
  $ ./script/generate scaffold Project name:string
  $ ./script/generate scaffold Task > name:string due_on:date
  $ rake db:migrate
  (in /Users/sarah/src/nestedmodels)
  ==  CreateProjects: migrating =================================================
  -- create_table(:projects)
     -> 0.0030s
  ==  CreateProjects: migrated (0.0032s) ========================================
  
  ==  CreateTasks: migrating ====================================================
  -- create_table(:tasks)
     -> 0.0032s
  ==  CreateTasks: migrated (0.0034s) ===========================================
  ```
  
  No if you point your browser at: http://localhost:3000/Projects  
  you can see your project list and if you click “new” and go to http://localhost:3000/Projects/new, you’ll see that we can create a new project and specify its name.

  But what we really want to do, is to be able to add task right on the same page and in the same post when we create the project
3. Create relationship between Projects and Tasks in the database  
  If Migrations are new to you, I recommend the awesome [Rails Guide chapter](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html). Note: “Prior to Rails 2.1 the migration number started at 1 and was incremented each time a migration was generated. With multiple developers it was easy for these to clash requiring you to rollback migrations and renumber them. With Rails 2.1 this is largely avoided by using the creation time of the migration to identify them.” ```
  $ script/generate migration AddProjectToTask project_id:integer
        exists  db/migrate
        create  db/migrate/20090502135510_add_project_to_task.rb
  ```
  
  This magically creates a complete migration file that adds the project\_id column which will store the has\_many relationship between projects and tasks:
  
  ```
  class AddProjectToTask < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      add_column :tasks, :project_id, :integer
    end
  
    def self.down
      remove_column :tasks, :project_id
    end
  end
  ```
  
  This magic is enabled by Rails naming conventions. If the migration name is of the form “AddXXXToYYY” or “RemoveXXXFromYYY” and is followed by a list of column names and types then the right migration will be generated. I couldn’t see anything about this in the help, but clearly the Rails folk don’t like to type much. Austin showed me the way, but I was happy to be able to read about it later in the [Migrations Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html).
  
  Now we can run the migration:
  
  ```
  $ rake db:migrate
  (in /Users/sarah/src/nestedmodels)
  ==  AddProjectToTask: migrating ===============================================
  -- add_column(:tasks, :project_id, :integer)
     -> 0.1163s
  ==  AddProjectToTask: migrated (0.1164s) ======================================
  ```
4. Create the relationship to Tasks in the Project model ```
  $ vi app/models/project.rb
  
  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :tasks
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :tasks
  end
  ```
  
  `has_many :tasks` is the standard long-time Rails way of declaring that a project has many tasks. `accepts_nested_attributes_for` is new in Rails 2.3 and will allow us to access the task attributes directly from the project model.
5. Create a form to allow creating and editing tasks within the project pages. ```
  code
  ```
