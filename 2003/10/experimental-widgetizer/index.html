<h1>experimental widgetizer</h1>

<p>Now it is easy to “steal this widget,” just click on those words in the OMPL viewer on the right side of this page and you can fill out a web form to get one for your own web site (or <a href="http://www.mylaszlo.com/cgi-bin/blogbox">click here</a>).</p>
<p>By storing settings in a database the verbose embed/object tag can be reduced to a single relatively short script tag. With a little help from my friends, we put together a simple service to experiment with a viral adoption modes. <a href="http://lyndonwong.blogspot.com/">Lyndon Wong</a> wrote up some html pages, Yossie Silverman whipped up a perl script, and <a href="http://drdreff.blogspot.com">Mark Davis</a> updated the Laszlo application.</p>
<p>Is a hierarchical list of links compelling enough to instigate viral adoption? Are there more folks like <a href="http://cogworks.manilasites.com">Andrew Wooldridge</a> who would want to put this on their sites, but didn’t want to dig through html-view-source to figure it out? I guess we’ll see :)</p>
<p>Special thanks to <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com">Laszlo Systems</a> for hosting and encouraging this experiment. You don’t even have to work there to do this kind of thing. Any one can post to <a href="http://www.mylaszlo.com">mylaszlo</a> and publish their own applications.</p>
