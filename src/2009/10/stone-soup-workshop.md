![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Austin_Hall%2C_Harvard_University.JPG/250px-Austin_Hall%2C_Harvard_University.JPG) Participating in the [Berkman Center Ruby on Rails Workshop for Women](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/genderandtech/ruby-on-rails-workshop-for-women/) was like making stone soup. Not to diminish my part as a teacher or the efforts of volunteers in San Francisco who worked to create the curriculum over the past several months, but the Boston area had all the makings of a successful workshop before I arrived.

[Liana Leahy](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lianaleahy/) ([@lleahy](http://twitter.com/lleahy)) and Mary Tolbert ([@mtolbert](http://twitter.com/mtolbert)) are vibrant leaders, skilled organizers, as well as strong technologists. Ruby on Rails developers from all of the Boston area were drawn by a clear need for teachers and mentors. Volunteers generously shared their experience and trouble-shooting skills. [ Andy Grigorowitz](http://twitter.com/eedrummer) [taught](http://gregorowicz.blogspot.com/2009/10/teaching-at-ruby-on-rails-workshop-for.html) the group who had no prior programming experience. Jim Barkley and Dev Purkayastha also volunteered to teach, but I think ended up joining the group of amazing TAs. The facilities at Harvard provided a supportive physical environment with wireless connections, power outlets embedded in the desks and microphones for each student to ask a question and be heard. The physical environment and supportive human presence contributed to a [sense of abundance](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/08/psychology-of-abundance/) that I feel is a key part of the workshopâ€™s success.

As important as the event itself are the activities which follow. [Josh Nichols](http://technicalpickles.com/) and others from Boston Ruby warmly welcomed workshop participants into their midst. The [Boston Ruby group](http://bostonrb.org/) offers frequent meetings on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Tuesday of every month, representing a thriving community of developers. Because so many local developers showed up and offered friendly assistance, it means that people from the workshop can attend a Boston Ruby meetup or hack session and maybe they will already know someone there. It is a powerful thing feeling that you are amongst friends.

I was inspired and honored to be a part of this event. It is my hope and expectation that the work will continue through the [Open Source Code Crunch](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/genderandtech/ruby-on-rails-workshop-for-women/open-source-code-crunch/) and future workshops.
