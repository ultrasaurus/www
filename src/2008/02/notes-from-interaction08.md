Take aways from [Amitava Sinharay](http://interaction08.crowdvine.com/posts/show/493414). I’ve added some of my own…

Alan Cooper  
– Create the insurgency!  
– Software is not a problem to be solved, it is a process.  
– Programming is craftsmenship.  
– programmers respect competence not authority — they can’t be managed, only “facilitated”  
– there is no real scarcity of time and money, yet we are confronted with that scarcity every day

Gretchen Anderson  
– Keep the momentum … go for it!

Sarah Allen  
– Create fans not users.

Sigi Moeslinger  
– Design is a form of intervention.

Bill DeRouchey  
– Inspiration is around us.

Bill Buxton  
– Experience shouldn’t suck.  
– Designer rhymes with whiner- but STOP WHINING!  
– Everybody is not a designer.  
– There is no such thing as low fidelity or high fidelity prototype- only right or wrong prototype.  
– The only way to engineer the future tomorrow is to have lived it yesterday!  
– Your value lies in your distinctiveness

Gretchen Anderson  
– the difference between a newspaper report and a story  
– synthesize detail  
– “don’t be afraid to be wrong, be afraid of not making a statement”

Carl DiSalvo  
– most people have no experience with design: you don’t go home and prototype dinner, you just make it

Bill DeRouchey  
– make a specific button the “hero”

Gabriel White  
– provide people with an understanding of their own behavior

Aza Raskin  
– don’t force users to ask for more content, just give it to them!  
– create a “moment of delight”

Jenny Lam  
– software is both art &amp; craft  
– emotion and idea are supreme  
– designers think with their hands and have the ability to communicate through actions
