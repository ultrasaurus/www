Jon Udell [writes](http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/08/20/collective-mind-probes/) about [brandtags.net](http://blog.jonudell.net/2008/08/20/collective-mind-probes/), an experiment in identifying brand associations. As much as marketing folks work hard to create a brand, at the end of the day, the brand is defined by your associations. This site attempts to capture those from its audience.

Most often a brand is defined by its flagship product. [Campbells](http://www.brandtags.net/browselt.php?id=574) is **soup**. [Google](http://www.brandtags.net/browselt.php?id=2) and [Yahoo](http://www.brandtags.net/browselt.php?id=25) are **search**. [Adobe](http://www.brandtags.net/browselt.php?id=38) is **photoshop**. However, [Microsoft](http://www.brandtags.net/browselt.php?id=127) is **evil**.

The cloud tag visualization is nice, but the top words are way too large when displayed in “orderly view.” They should lose the word scaling if ordering by popularity, I think… or else figure out how to adjust the scale so the biggest font is not quite so big.
