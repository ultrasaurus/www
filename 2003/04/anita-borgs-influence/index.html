<h1>Anita Borg&amp;#8217;s influence&amp;#8230;</h1>

<p>Anita Borg influenced my life in an unexpected way. She organized a conference, “The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women and Computing,” which I attended in 1997.</p>
<p>I thought I had overcome the feeling of being an alien in the workplace. Perhaps you know what it is like, to look around the room at a meeting and feel alone in a roomful of people. Or to talk seriously to someone and then realize that they were only talking to your haircut.</p>
<p>This conference was unique. It wasn’t just a women’s conference. It was a technical conference. Over a few days, I listened to more women speak publicly about gory technical details than I had in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I caught myself thinking… I could do that. And I thought that it had never occurred to me that I couldn’t.</p>
<p>Anita Borg died last week. You can read <a href="http://www.iwt.org/news/anitaborg/anitaborgmemorial.htm">more about her</a> on the pages of the Institute for Women and Technology.</p>
