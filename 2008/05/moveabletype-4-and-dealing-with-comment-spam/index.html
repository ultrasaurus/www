<h1>moveabletype 4 and dealing with comment spam</h1>

<p>I’ve been letting comments build up in my moderation queue, since I have been overwhelmed by the amount of spam. Today, I decided to upgrade to mt4 to see if the new version offered anything better. I got a 500 error at first, but found in my apache logs:</p>
<p>error: “file is writable by others”<br>
Found via google that I needed to: chmod 755<br>
I usually just a+x, but that seemed to work.</p>
<p>Other than that, MovableType was a delight to install, as always.</p>
<p>Eek! All of the comments I had marked as junk were simply unpublished after the upgrade. I couldn’t deal with 45,000 comments via the GUI, so I decided to walk on the edge and edit directly via SQL… I had just backed up my database, right?</p>
<p>So… for the record, this is what worked:<br>
mysql&gt; DELETE FROM mt_comment WHERE comment_visible IS NULL;<br>
Query OK, 45176 rows affected (7.54 sec)</p>
<p>Then, I decide to go after my trackback spam:<br>
mysql&gt; DELETE FROM mt_tbping WHERE tbping_blog_name LIKE “%Jhony%”;<br>
Query OK, 46535 rows affected (5.31 sec)</p>
<p>mysql&gt; DELETE FROM mt_tbping WHERE tbping_blog_name LIKE “%sex%”;<br>
Query OK, 37 rows affected (0.03 sec)</p>
<p>mysql&gt; DELETE FROM mt_tbping WHERE tbping_blog_name LIKE “%loans%”;<br>
Query OK, 171 rows affected (0.04 sec)</p>
<p>finally, I decided my time was more important than finding the elusive valid trackback, so I deleted them all:</p>
<p>mysql&gt; DELETE FROM mt_tbping;</p>
<p>Ok, all is good, or so I thought. I’ve got my old blog with the new MT. However, I wanted to try out authentication for comments, but when I turn it on, I get an error when I post a new comment that registration is required. I suppose I need to update my “Entry” template, so I look up the MT4 <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/documentation/designer/movable-type-40-default-templa.html">default templates</a>. However, if I paste in the <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/default_templates/4.0/entry.mtml">entry template</a>, I get an error. Sigh.</p>
