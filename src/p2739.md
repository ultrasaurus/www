A while ago I read [an article](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/about/newspubs/news/ViewNews.aspx?id=2455&newslabel=hn) about some research from Victoria University PhD graduate Paul Sulzberger. “Dr Sulzberger has found that the best way to learn a language is through frequent exposure to its sound patterns—even if you haven’t a clue what it all means.”

I’ve decided to test this theory in learning Japanese. I don’t want to learn just any Japanese. I aspire to be able to understand tech talks at the Japanese Ruby conference, Ruby Kaigi.
