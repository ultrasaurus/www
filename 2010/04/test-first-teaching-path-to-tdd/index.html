<h1>test first teaching, path to TDD</h1>

<p>Over the past year I’ve taught about a dozen sessions of Ruby language or Ruby on Rails programming classes. I’ve been using a combination of presentation, live coding demonstration, follow along with irb (Ruby’s interactive scripting environment) and <a href="http://testfirst.org">test-first teaching exercises</a>. I’ve reflected on what works well and experimented with curriculum and teaching style modifications for the sections where students struggled. I’ve found a sequence which works very effectively. I believe it could be applied to teaching any programming language, and perhaps to teaching anything.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Conceptual Overview</strong> A presentation of the concept: why it is important, what it can do, how it works. How it fits into the bigger picture (if applicable). Pictures and diagrams are great here.</li>
<li><strong>Experimentation (Play)</strong> My goal in this section is to create a feeling of play… at best, with grown-ups, I think I’ve achieved a sense of experimentation or, perhaps, what the Talent Code calls “deep practice”</li>
<li><strong>Demonstration of a Real-World Example</strong> A live coding demonstration that solves a real problem. I often use this as an opportunity to test-drive the example, which illustrates the concept from two angles: the test (expectation) and implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Simple hands-on exercise</strong> Test first teaching examples where the student is given a test that fails and they have to apply what they just learned to write code and make the test pass.</li>
</ol>
<p>This was the context of my talk tonight at the <a href="http://ruby.meetup.com/81/calendar/12145157/">East Bay Ruby Meetup</a>. I talked about teaching methodologies, demonstrated a test-first exercise, then talked about moving on to test-driven development.</p>
