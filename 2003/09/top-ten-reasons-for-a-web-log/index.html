<h1>top ten reasons for a web log</h1>

<p>For a while I’ve been thinking about why I enjoy blogging. The reasons I created this weblog remain, but I’ve discovered more and different reasons over time. My approach has changed substantially since my second posting posed the question: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/2003_03.html">Are blogs the vanity press of the Internet?</a></p>
<p>Since I’ve read and enjoyed many blogger top ten lists, I plan to write this list as a series of posts. As I write them, I’ll link them back from here for future reference. In chronological order:</p>
<p>#1: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000064.html">participatory geekiness</a><br>
#2: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000067.html">gender issues</a><br>
#3: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000082.html">giving back</a><br>
#4: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000081.html">reverse search engine</a><br>
#5: thinking practice: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000086.html">language is the vehicle of thought</a><br>
#6: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000101.html">marking the passage of time</a><br>
#7: writing practice: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000122.html">just do it</a><br>
#8: finding my voice: <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/archives/000348.html">just do it</a></p>
