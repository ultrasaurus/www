“GNOME had no Summer of Code applications from women, so the project said it’s time to do something to encourage more women to join its development community.” ([DesktopLinux](http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7604769318.html))

Gosh, I wish I was still a student. That sounds like a lot of fun. If you are a female student or you know one, check out the [GNOME Summer Outreach Program](http://live.gnome.org/SummerOutreachProjects). It’s great to see open source projects encouraging women to join in the fun!
