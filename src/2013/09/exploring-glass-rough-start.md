[![Judy tries out Google Glass](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3810/9691699736_a134f48e54_n.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/67857234@N00/9691699736/ "Judy tries out Google Glass by sarah_allen2000, on Flickr") So I got a chance to explore Google Glass tonight. Setup took two tries, apparently it doesn’t work on 5G wifi ([Kalvin](http://twitter.com/kalvin) found via Google search) and then we all delighted in flailing around with swipe and tap gestures to figure out how to use the thing. I took a photo of [Judy](twitter.com/judytuna) trying to get it to play a video… not quite the streamlined experience we’ve been led to expect, but that’s ok. We’re explorers. It’s fun.

She made [this first person chinese ribbons video](https://plus.google.com/106689835670274491358/posts/aUWg5YAafke) and I recorded [this video of the same chinese ribbons](https://plus.google.com/106689835670274491358/posts/4EaaLXWKKgs) from a 3rd person perspective. Then I shared them to Google+, sadly I can embed them in my blog.

Then I accidentally started a hangout with EVERYONE in all of my google circles. Luckily I don’t really use Google+ that much, so I \*only\* invited 82 people to my hangout! Most of my friends and acquaintances were fairly entertained.

I have all sorts of ideas for apps, mostly silly and fun, some serious. Looking forward to exploring more…
