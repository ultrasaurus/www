“Harder,” male-dominated science and engineering fields, such as computer science, are paid more than female-dominated biological sciences, a “softer” science. (from [the wage gap starts when you pick your major](http://girlwpen.com/?p=1699))

I remember when all sciences were male-dominated and there was nothing soft about biology. Computer science was once relegated to females with the prestige going to the hardware inventors. This whole discussion reminds me of the Gloria Steinum essay “[If men could menstruate](http://www.haverford.edu/psych/ddavis/p109g/steinem.menstruate.html).”
