I created it in about ten minutes with the fabulous [click-shirt](http://www.click-shirt.com/) app (created in [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org) by the awe-inspiring [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)).

Since it is so easy to make a store, I set it up so you can even buy one yourself, if you like it:
