<h3><a href="/2004/01/mars-landing-of-spirit-rover/">Mars landing of “Spirit” Rover</a></h3>
<p><em>2004-01-05</em></p>
<p>My Very Excellent Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas. I found this effective mnemonic at <a href="http://www.the-solar-system.net/">the-solar-system.net</a>. It helped me remember the order of the planets which I felt important to get right this weekend. Inspired by the Mars landing, I visited the <a href="http://www.chabotspace.org/">Chabot Space &amp; Science Center</a> today and watched an interesting episode of Nova.</p>
<p>About half way through the television program, I wondered… are there any women who work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory? Of the dozens of engineers who appeared on screen, I spotted two — one on the parachute team and one software engineer. I suppose a few brief appearances are better than none. Perhaps my son didn’t notice, more excited by his toy replica of the Viking lander than the testimony of boring grown-ups, but I believe that such experiences have a subconscious effect. I had hoped that our generation would be offering more gendered balanced role models by 2004.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, something else I learned today: do you know why Mickey Mouse went to outer space? to see Pluto, of course.</p>
