[Adam Wolff](http://laszlosystems.com/~adam/blog/) has started a blog. His first entry “[Why I like JavaScript (Part I)](http://www.laszlosystems.com/~adam/blog/archives/000013.html)” details Javascript’s \_\_proto\_\_ construct. He also includes an LZX unit test which demonstrates his point. It runs in the web page and you can even click on “edit program” to modify and re-run the test.

I must admit to ambivalence on the use of scripting languages. It somehow feels more comfortable to slip into C or C++ with their mature IDEs and close-to-the-machine power. However, I have long been enamored of how quickly I can create an application using a scripting language that provides useful high level objects — no need to allocate memory, write header files, or create a grafport, device context, gworld or whatever.

I’ve lived in XML and Javascript for almost a year at [Laszlo Systems](http://www.laszlosystems.com) and its been a lot of fun. I’ve enjoyed working with Adam who knows well how to make Javascript roll over and do tricks. I look forward to futher reading at [Victor Laszlo Moholy](http://laszlosystems.com/~adam/blog/).
