<h1>rails routes</h1>

<p>I just went through a <a href="http://darynholmes.wordpress.com/2008/03/15/beginners-tutorial-routing-in-rails-20-with-rest-part-1-of-n/">fabulous tutorial</a> by Daryn Holmes about routes. It is written for 2.0.2, but I found that nothing had changed for 2.2. I already had a good feel for how routes worked, but stepping through the details was very helpful.</p>
<p>Key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default controllers render the view that has the same name of the action invoked.</li>
<li>index is the default action</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Debugging Tips:</strong><br>
You can quickly see where a route ends up by typing this into irb:</p>
<pre><code>
&gt;&gt; rts = ActionController::Routing::Routes
&gt;&gt; rts.recognize_path(&quot;/&quot;)
=&gt; {:controller=&gt;&quot;albums&quot;, :action=&gt;&quot;index&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>You can also go in the reverse direction to see what URL would be generated by a route. To see what URL an action will end up at:</p>
<pre><code>
&gt;&gt; rts.generate(:controller=&gt;'albums',:action=&gt;'index')
=&gt; &quot;/music&quot;
</code></pre>
