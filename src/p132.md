With this model, it is essential to make clear what maintain cues of what data

Personally I would like every app I use to have infinite levels of undo, but I believe that ‘undo’ is really a ‘power user’ feature. (For two reasons: first, you need to be a fairly sophisticated compter user to even know the feature is there; more importantly, you need to be an experienced user of a particular application to trust that the feature will be available when you are doing your work. The existence of this feature changes behavior.)

Also, as an engineer, I like revision control systems. It sure is nice to be able to see every change that’s been submitted with a date-time stamp and identity. It strikes me that perhaps everyone isn’t like me, and maybe I’m not even like that when I’m focused on a different task.

The back button or just abandoning a page provides an implicit cancel for any action. If an RIA were to save more proactively would it break that implicit assumption?
