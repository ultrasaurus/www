Due to unforeseen circumstances, the event at google that was scheduled for tomorrow has been canceled. We are, however, working to re-schedule it at another venue early next year. Updates will be posted at the [eniacprogrammers website](http://eniacprogrammers.org/) and there is an email list you can subscribe to for news. If you have any great ideas about a good SF Bay Area venue or if you want to volunteer to help organize the event, [let me know](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/emailme.php)!
