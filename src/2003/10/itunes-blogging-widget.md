[ptw](http://pt.withy.org/ptalk/) has adapted the OPML viewer to display his currectly playing iTunes. (PC users have to go find a Mac to see it.) The integration with iTunes via AppleScript is the new special sauce. As you can see from the [code](http://mylaszlo.com/lps/ptw/tunaroll/tunaroll.lzx?lzt=source), the app still imports OPML and the LZX changes are purely user interface. Read more about [how it was created](http://pt.withy.org/ptalk/archives/2003/09/the_ubiquitous_blogging_widget.html) on his blog.
