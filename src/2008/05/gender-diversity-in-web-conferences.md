I was doing a little research for a friend and found some nice resources for women speakers. [Jason Kottle](http://www.kottle.org) collected some [great stats](http://www.kottke.org/07/02/gender-diversity-at-web-conferences) about representation of women at web conferences. Every year or so, someone asks me a question like this, so I thought I would post a few pointers.

Itâ€™s pretty awesome that people are collecting and publishing resources for conference organizers. I find the focused lists most effective:

- Flash Goddess has the a great [women speaker list](http://www.flashgoddess.com/html/speakers.html) , with topics and details about each speakers area of expertise
- LinuxChix offers [Chix who Speak](http://www.linuxchix.org/chix-who-speak.html)
- BlogHer, of course, has great women who talk about blogging [2007](http://www.blogher.com/blogher-07-speakers), [2006](http://workerbees.typepad.com/BlogHer06DayTwo_WEB.html)

[Other](http://www.misbehaving.net/2005/11/collective_conf.html) [lists](http://www.personism.com/2006/10/11/list-of-women-speakers-for-your-conference/) are very broad, and it is hard to see what exactly people are expert at.

Know any lists I missed? Please comment and I will pass them on.
