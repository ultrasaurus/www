Steve Yegge [writes](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html) about learning to type and ridicules programmers like me who don’t touch type (via [HMK](http://www.extragroup.de/weblog/hmk/archives/004774.html)).

I actually learned to touch type in 7th grade, but that was too long before I spent any serious time typing, so I forgot my hard-earned skill by the time I needed it.

I’ve taken his challenge and decided to devote a half hour every day to learning to touch type. According to [TyperShark](http://www.popcap.com/gamepopup.php?theGame=typershark) I type 58 words per minute using my normal style of glancing at the keyboard every word or two. However, I set myself the challenge of only peeking when I absolutely have to. As it turns out, i don’t really know where the ‘b’ and the ‘w’ are after all these years.

Sunday 9/13, Day 1: start 24 wpm, end 38 wpm (I also tried [Typing of the Dead](http://downloads.gamezone.com/demos/d2037.htm) where I could only type 7 wpm… while entertaining, the requirement of killing zombies clearly reduces my productivity.) I also tried a [free typing test](http://www.freetypinggame.net/play4.asp) where you type real sentences and I did 28 wpm.
