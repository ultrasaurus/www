I’m looking forward to going to [blogher](http://www.blogher.org/) next week. I am honored to be selected as a [six apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) scholar at Blogher. I liked the questions asked by six apart, so I’ve posted them below with my repsonse.

Who else is going to the conference? Wanna meet up? Anyone interested in carpooling from SF? (send me a [note](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/emailme.php) if you have room in your car)
