Maps are a natural way to use images to visualize a lot of data in a small space, or even a little bit of data in an interesting way.

I was inspired by [IndyJunior](http://www.bryanboyer.com/indyjunior/) to spend last Sunday afternoon experimenting with maps. Using the IndyJunior Flash application I mapped [places I’ve lived](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/indyjr/). It’s a very easy process that consists of editing an XML file with your locations and clicking buttons in a nify configuration app that let’s you select the look-and-feel of the map.

The IndyLog also points to some other fun maps, like a [map guestbook ](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/indyjr/guestmap.html) . Is it just a fun novelty to index notes by geographic location? or does it add meaning?
