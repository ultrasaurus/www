The [Golden Gate Ruby Conference](http://gogaruco.com/) was one of the best technical conferences I’ve attended. In addition to my links (below), you can look at [pivotallabs live blogging and justin.tv videos](http://pivotallabs.com/gogaruco). Justin.tv, which has a Ruby-powered website, provided [full coverage](http://www.justin.tv/gogaruco), and videos will be posted on the [pivotal labs](http://pivotallabs.com/gogaruco/talks) website.

I really liked the format and venue. The Sweedish American hall was rustic, in stark contrast to its central location on Market street with easy access to public transit. It is located right above Cafe du Nord where I used to hear Charles Brown play. The physical setup of the event was awesome where there were tables at the front, back and balcony for people (like me) who wanted to blog and take notes, as well as the usual chairs for people who mostly wanted to listen to watch. I really liked that they scheduled 15 minute breaks between each talk which allowed for informal discussion of the topic (or for wrapping up a blog post).

Below are the talks that I took notes on, in rough order of awesome-ness. Of the the more awesome talks, for which I have no notes, was about physical computing with [Ruby Aduino Development](http://rad.rubyforge.org/) (RAD), see [Chad Woolley’s notes](http://pivotallabs.com/users/chad/blog/articles/805-gogaruco-09-arduino-is-rails-for-hardware-hacking-greg-borenstein).

The [only bummer](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/) of the event was the extreme gender imbalance and one innappropriate presentation that [serveral](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/?p=46) [folks](http://dyepot-teapot.com/2009/04/25/dear-fellow-rubyists/) have [also](http://www.rubyrailways.com/rails-is-still-a-ghetto/) blogged about. I want to reiterate that I don’t think this is reflective of the state of our society, in particular, of open source software, rather than a problem unique to the Ruby community. Time to move on and figure out how to better diversify the community (but that’s a subject for a differnt post).

Overall an awesome conference. Many thanks to [Josh](http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/) and Leah, [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com/), [EngineYard](http://www.engineyard.com/), [AT&amp;T Interactive](http://betalabs.yellowpages.com/), [New Relic](http://www.newrelic.com/) and the many other sponsors, volunteers and speakers who made it happen. I look forward to attending next year!
