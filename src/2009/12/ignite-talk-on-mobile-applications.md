I really enjoyed the Bay Area Ignite talks last night both giving mine and hearing the others. Preparing for a 5 minute talk was brutal, but giving it was really kind of fun. The format is 20 slides auto-rotated at 15 seconds per slide accompanied by a 5 minute talk.

Update: Hereâ€™s the talk [on video](http://www.channels.com/episodes/15517069).

Here are my slides:
