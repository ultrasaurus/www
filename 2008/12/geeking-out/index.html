<h1>geeking out</h1>

<p>I’ve been learning Ruby on Rails over the past couple of days and have decided to chronicle my <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/code/">adventures in code</a> in a separate spot. I’ve found that my regular readers tend to be a diverse crowd and some of their eyes tend to glaze over when I’ve delved into the nitty details of code.</p>
<p>Feel free to join me over at <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/code/">ultrasaurus.com/code</a> if you like to write (or at least read about) code, although I will continue my still geeky, but less code-filled reflections here.</p>
