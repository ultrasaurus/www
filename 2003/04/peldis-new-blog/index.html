<h1>Peldi&amp;#8217;s new blog</h1>

<p>I am happy to report that Giacomo ‘Peldi’ Guilizzoni has started a <a href="http://www.peldi.com/blog">blog</a>.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="http://www.peldi.com/blog/000005.html">post</a> with his “peopleboard” component is a great example of an innovative way to display presence. As the internet evolves with an ever-increasing number of continuously connected computers, awareness of presence emerges as an important user interface concept.</p>
<p>Developers of Flash Communication Server applications will be excited to see that he has provided a number of cool components for download.</p>
