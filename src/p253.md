I had the pleasure of meeting Doug Engelbart in 2002, when [Kevin Lynch](http://www.klynch.com/) had the brilliant idea of inviting Doug to attend our launch event in NYC remotely. I volunteered to stay home and run tech support for Doug. His Augment system predated our efforts by almost 40 years and included more features. It was humbling. As the event began, Kevin has a couple of other items on the agenda before the big finale with Doug. Kevin talked about how we need to be mindful and respectful of our critics. Doug and I were listening in (on mute) from his home in Atherton. Macromedia had made great efforts to address concerns raised most vocally by Jacob Nielson, who had written scathing criticisms of Flash. At which point, Doug said to me: “Jakob never liked my work either.” Mike Chambers tells a [good story](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mesh/archives/2002/07/macromedia_keyn.html) of the event as witnessed by the audience:

“Kevin then talked about some of the pioneering work done in computers in the 50’s and 60’s, and introduced a clip of a presentation by Doug Engelbart, and his famous [1968 video](http://sloan.stanford.edu/mousesite/1968Demo.html) of distributed collaboration and real-time video in a graphical computer.  
It is really hard to describe the excitement and electricity in the audience while viewing the clips. You will have to use the link above to view them. We showed the introduction to the presentation, and doug typing on the screen, and then a clip where he was collaborating with someone remotely (using text and video!).  
Kevin then opened up a Flash Communication Server application, which linked him and Flash Forward to Palo Alto, California and Doug Engelbart. When he came through on the video, the audience gave the loudest and longest applause of the morning.  
Doug talked about how after he got engaged, he realized he didn’t have any long term goals. He decided that he should dedicate himself to making a positive difference to humankind, and that one way to do that would be to figure out a way to make communication and collaboration easier. Doug, who has actually used director in the past, said that he would like to see applications that make it simple to connect users via video, and then archive and search that video (as easy as searching and indexing text on the web).”
