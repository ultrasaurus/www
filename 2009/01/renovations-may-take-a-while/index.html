<p>I’ve been periodically trying to fix comments on this weblog with no luck. Since I started this weblog in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030326155324/http://ultrasaurus.com/">2003</a> with Movable Type 2.63, I have upgraded it every year or two and periodically added do-dads and code snippets. Sometimes it is easier to start fresh than to fix what’s there.</p>
<p>This morning I decided to completely recreate this blog and the comment system does seem to work. If you have posted a comment in the last couple of years I made you a trusted commenter. If you are a new friend (or one of my old friends who reads this and then never says anything), the next time you comment I will make you trusted. If you are a trusted commenter, then comments will be posted immediately. If the new MT is better at spam prevention, then maybe I’ll just let anyone comment, but I had over 7000 spam comments that I just deleted so it has been a bit of a problem.</p>
<p>Please post a comment to help me test. Feel free to give me any feedback on blog design. I plan to bring back in elements of the <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/backup-2009-01-03/">old design</a> after ensuring that the functionality is working. Do folks like the new three-column layout or is it too cluttered? Should I post an image of me with my new purple hair?</p>
<p>The tag cloud is obviously broken. I’ll tackle that next. Please let me know if you see anything else funky.</p>
<p>[Update: moved to WordPress and the lovely thematic theme.]</p>
