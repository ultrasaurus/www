Over the past decade, I’ve done quite a bit of hiring. It’s that time again and a good chunk of my time is spent reading resumes, interviewing, and talking to references. While it is fresh in my mind, I thought I would write down what I wish the person on the **other side** would do. Here’s my list of tips on getting hired. I don’t know if every one of these is universal, but here’s what works with me:

- [write a freaking cover letter](http://www.antisleep.com/archives/2004-05-25_0251.php)
- say thank you: get a card from each person you interview with. If you want the job, send them a quick note afterwards.
