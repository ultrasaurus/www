<h1>connecting digital music to cultural heritage</h1>

<p>Digital music has evolved beyond simply distribution. Napster, iTunes, and Spotify transformed our expectations of being able to find and listen to music. On a parallel track, services like Pandora pioneered new ways to find music and the evolution of social networks let us discover music from our friends. There are new services like <a href="http://www.preamp.fm/">preamp</a> that let us discover live music in a city or <a href="http://blog.percolate.com/2014/05/spotifys-new-ads-reveal-social-matters-millenials/">Spotify playlists</a> that let us express ourselves through music, perhaps a natural evolution of the mixtape.</p>
<p>Music also connects us to memory and provide a hook to learning about history and culture. We also have incredible music collections, which are annotated with “meta-data” which can often position the music in place and time, and sometimes provide interesting connections and links.</p>
