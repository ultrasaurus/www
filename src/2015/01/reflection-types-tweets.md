[Dan Moore](https://twitter.com/mooreds) has an interesting way of looking at tweets, analyzing what kinds of tweets — “conversational posts” perhaps a question, provocative statement or something else, vs sharing links, retweeting or replies.

Here’s my chart from [Twitversation](http://twitversation.mooreds.com/?username=ultrasaurus):

Out of the last 200 tweets, [ultrasaurus](https://twitter.com/ultrasaurus) had 20 conversational posts (blue), 38 posts with a link (yellow), 79 retweets (red), and 63 replies (green).
