For the Laszlo developers amongst my readers…

I wrote a little interactive debugging tool that I have found very useful in my own app development. It lets you inspect the view hierachy and see and modify key properties (bgcolor, position, size, visible).

You can try it [here](http://www.mylaszlo.com/lps-2.1/metasarah/inspector-example/inspector-example.lzx?lzt=html). You can change bgcolor and view position. Click on the x/o to toggle visibility. Click on ‘…’ will send the instance to the debugger, where you can click on it for further inspection.

You can download a zip of the source from the [mylaszlo forum](http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/community/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=715).
