“Behaviors associated with harassment are especially prevalent among men who say their company does not have guidelines against harassment, hotlines to report it or punishment for perpetrators, or who say their managers don’t care.”

“Research finds that sexual harassment occurs when it is tolerated — that is, when policies are not enforced and when incidents are not taken seriously,” — Vicki Magley, a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut

“Social norms come into play.” says John Pryor an emeritus distinguished professor of psychology at Illinois State University, whose [US Armed Forces research](http://militarymedicine.amsus.org/doi/pdf/10.7205/MILMED-D-04-2308) indicated that behavior of colleagues, especially immediate leaders, affects whether men engage in harassing behavior.

“the percentage of women who said they had experienced one of eight harassing behaviors in the last two years was 18 percent, less than half the percentage it was in 1994.” (from [study of federal employees](https://www.mspb.gov/MSPBSEARCH/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=1442317&version=1447804&application=ACROBAT)) — as a young woman in 1994, I had no idea that 36% of women were experiencing sexual harassment in a workplace as highly regulated as the federal government
