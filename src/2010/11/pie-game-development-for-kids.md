At RubyConf this year, we hosted a [Kids Track](https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2010/11/kids-track-at-rubyconf-details/). One of the activities was to make web adventure games.

If you want to make a Pie game, go to the [pie-bakery](http://pie-bakery.heroku.com/). If you have questions about creating games with pie or suggestions for improvements, you can sign up to this [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/pie-dev) and post questions or ideas via the web or email.

Check out the games that the kids made this week:

- [Path of the Point, Sharp Teeth](http://pie-bakery.heroku.com/play/17/start)
- [Labrynth](http://pie-bakery.heroku.com/play/15/start)

I also gave a talk at the conference about the making of Pie. Here are the slides from the talk:

We just created a [pie-cooks](http://groups.google.com/group/pie-cooks) google group for people who are working on creating/improving Pie.
