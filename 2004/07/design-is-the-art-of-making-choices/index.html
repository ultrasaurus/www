<h1>design is the art of making choices</h1>

<p>“Hallelujah!” It sure feels good to hear someone acknowledge that <a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/07/07/1640244">usability is a technical problem</a>.</p>
<p>For a while I’ve been reflecting upon the lack of good user interface design in open source systems. Of course, I more freqently reflect upon the lack of good user interface design in general. Good UI is hard, but as Frans Englich points out the open source approach has licked a number of hard problems. Security is hard too.</p>
<p>I believe that good design is all about making choices and applying a bit of common sense. We need to take the time to really think about the decisions that we ask people to make when they use our software.</p>
<p>I enjoyed <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000059.html">Joel Spolsky’s observation</a> that the Options dialog is an archaeological record for software development. “It is the height of arrogance for a software designer to inflict a choice … on the user simply because the designer couldn’t think hard enough to decide which option is really better.”</p>
<p>Havoc Pennington also discusses <a href="http://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html">the question of preferences</a>. “For any program, there are literally an infinite number of possible preferences. Each one has a cost. … the UI developer’s job is to choose the useful subset of possible preferences.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why every software engineer doesn’t care about the human experience. If people don’t use the software we write what’s the point?</p>
