<h1>Pizza, Beer and AJAX</h1>

<p>Laszlo is sponsoring a <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/community/event_060314.php">developer meet-up</a> on March 16.</p>
<p>Those of you not privvy to the wild flurry of checkins on the laszlo-dev mailing list may not have heard that our oft-told story of LZX as a platform-independent language has recently been validated with a DHTML/Ajax implementation. You can follow some of the gory technical details at the blogs of <a href="http://blog.maxcarlson.com/">Max Carlson</a>, <a href="http://secretartofscience.com/blog/">Adam Wolff</a>, and the <a href="http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/">OpenLaszlo weblog</a>.</p>
<p>It is something you just gotta see to believe — the same source code compiles to either Flash or DHTML. Of course, the applications are pure Laszlo. As usual, the demo application doesn’t really look like Flash or DHTML — Ajax may be the technical term du jour, but this is <strong>cinematic</strong>. Check it out at David Temkin’s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8498">etech talk</a> next week or in SF at the meet-up the week after.</p>
<p>Also, Laszlo developers! This is your chance to show off your projects. Sign up to give a demo or just come to hang out and chat about LZX or your latest cool interface idea.</p>
<p>Space is limited… <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/community/event_060314.php">reserve your spot now</a>.</p>
