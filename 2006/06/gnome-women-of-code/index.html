<h1>GNOME women of code</h1>

<p>“GNOME had no Summer of Code applications from women, so the project said it’s time to do something to encourage more women to join its development community.” (<a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7604769318.html">DesktopLinux</a>)</p>
<p>Gosh, I wish I was still a student. That sounds like a lot of fun. If you are a female student or you know one, check out the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/SummerOutreachProjects">GNOME Summer Outreach Program</a>. It’s great to see open source projects encouraging women to join in the fun!</p>
