<h1>Geekcorps</h1>

<p><img src="http://www.geekcorps.org/images/design/logo.gif" alt="">I just heard about <a href="http://www.geekcorps.org/">Geekcorps</a> (via <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/new-sfwow/">sfwow</a> mailing list). They describe themselves “as a non-profit moving at the speed of the Internet.”</p>
<p>“Geekcorps, a division of <a href="http://www.iesc.org/">IESC</a>, promotes economic growth in the developing world by sending highly skilled technology volunteers to teach communities how to use innovative and affordable information and communication technologies to solve development problems.”</p>
<p>I wish they had been around when I had summers off and lacked responsibilities that keep me at home. It sure seems like a fabulous way to see the world. I thought I would write about them in case any of YOU might like to volunteer :)</p>
