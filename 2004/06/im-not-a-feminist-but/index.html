<h1>I&amp;#8217;m not a feminist, but&amp;#8230;</h1>

<p>I appreciate the right to help choose my government representatives. I enjoy the option of wearing pants or shorts if I want. I’m pleased that I was allowed to learn to read and write. It can be very convenient to control how many babies I want to have. It’s awfully useful to be able to open a bank account and own property in my name. I like knowing that my husband or boyfriend cannot legally beat me. It’s really swell to keep the money that I earn.</p>

<p>p.s. actually, I’m not so shy of using the f-word to describe myself, but I really liked this poster which I saw on my travels</p>
