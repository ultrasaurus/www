<p>Serious Client-side Programming is Back: Rich Internet Applications, Web UI, and LZX by Eric Bloch &amp; David Temkin, Laszlo Systems, Inc</p>
<p>Because of the nature of HTML, the UI of Web applications<br>
has suffered. There are now technologies and products<br>
available for building so-called “Rich Internet”<br>
applications that enable Java developers to provide Web<br>
UIs that are on par with or go beyond tradition desktop UIs.<br>
We will demo a few Rich Internet Applications and then go<br>
on to discuss LZX, Laszlo’s XML-based language, that<br>
enables development of Rich Internet Applications using<br>
industry standards, including XML, JavaScript, and XPath.</p>
