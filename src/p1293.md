Ask good questions

- always search before you post
- include all the info someone would need to answer your question (without needing to answer a question with a question 
  - what are you trying to achieve, as short as you can: why is this question important to you?
  - what versions of relevant software you are using (e.g. Ruby 1.8.6, Rails 2.2.2 for a Rails question or Win XP, Firefox 3.0.1 for a Javascript question)
  - where else have you looked? (e.g. help, specific documentation pages)
