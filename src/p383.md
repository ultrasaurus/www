Memes never die in Cyberspace… got [tagged](http://www.sauria.com/blog/2006/12/21#1566) in this game in 2006, but just noticed now.

1\. I was impossibly shy as a child and early teenager. (blogging was not an innately natural act)  
2\. Coolest date ever: dinner with [Little Steven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Van_Zandt) and his band at Jack’s Family Restaurant in RI — my then boyfriend (now husband) was interviewing him for a story and Steve invited us both to dinner  
3\. I learned to program on an Apple II  
4\. Garden  
5\. I was once arrested for protesting the Seabrook nuclear power plan in NH
