<h1>Laszlo OPML viewer</h1>

<p>Inspired by Mark Davis’ <a href="http://drdreff.blogspot.com/2003_09_07_drdreff_archive.html#106305830618139273">Laszlo link viewer</a>, I created a little <a href="http://host2.ultrasaurus.com:8080/lps/my-apps/opml/opml.xml">OPML file</a> with some of my collected links and modified his LZX file to read the data from the there. [Moved this version of the app into this blog entry, since I am going to update my gutter]</p>
<p>The new app is only 60 lines of <a href="http://host2.ultrasaurus.com:8080/lps/my-apps/opml/opmlviewer.lzx?lzt=source">code</a>. LZX is fun!</p>
<p>It took me about two hours, from inspiration to deployment. Here’s what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>I read a bit about OPML. I ended up snagging the OPML file from <a href="http://www.blogrolling.com/">blogrolling.com</a> and then hand-edited to create some categories. I wonder if I upgrade my account and have multiple blogrolls, does it generates a single hierarchical OPML? … that would be nice.</li>
<li>I borrowed the code and art assets — thanks Mark</li>
<li>I modified the LZX:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>added a dataset that references opml.xml</li>
<li>added datapaths to various views</li>
<li>changed color definitions to canvas attributes (although I probably should have left these as parameters)</li>
<li>added rollover feedback for links</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>created a 2 frame Flash movie for the link icon, drawing two icons by hand (a little rough, but I like to have some feedback that a new window will be opened)</li>
<li>uploaded the files to the <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com">Laszlo Presentation Server</a> that I recently set up at <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net">mediatemple</a></li>
<li>updated my MoveableType default template</li>
</ol>
