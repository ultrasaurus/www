Just as the CD-ROM development herd is writhing in its long-awaited death throes, Macromedia has rushed forward with a life-support tech infusion – Shockwave is a blast of morphine that’ll keep the abysmal content-repurposing nightmare in deep REM. If you had any doubts about what the fate of over five years of largely worthless Director content would be, make no mistake: it’s coming to the Web in its full Grandma Bear On Quaaludes, Around-the-World in 80 Miserable Minutes, Mix-Your-Own David Bowie Digizine glory. The SOMA truism may be that multimedia is a solution in search of a problem, but most of us are starting to see it more as the problem itself.
