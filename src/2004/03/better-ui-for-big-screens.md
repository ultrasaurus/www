“Our user interface designs do not scale well to the available screen real estate. Windows are hard to access on very large or heterogeneous displays, like Tablets and non-touch-enabled devices. Notifications come up where one is not attending, and windows open in unexpected places or are improperly sized for their contents.” — [Microsoft Research VIBE](http://research.microsoft.com/vibe/), Visualization and Interaction for Business and Entertainment

The Microsoft team presents a number of ideas for dealing with complexity across large screens. I like the idea of [Drag-and-Pop](http://host130.ipowerweb.com/~patrickb/projects/dragandpop/demo/dragandpop.swf) which might help navigate even not so big. yet cluttered desktops like mine.
