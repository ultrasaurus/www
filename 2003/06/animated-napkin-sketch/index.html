<h1>animated napkin sketch</h1>

<p>In Ken Perlin’s recent <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/draw/">DrawPad</a> project, he explores creating an animation through sketching. There is a nice, simple visualization of history, which enables you to see your animation by rolling over it, edit the animation and insert new sketches.</p>
<p>It was developed with pen computing in mind and therefore uses a number of gesteral commands, so definitely check out the <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/draw/manual.html">user’s manual</a>. The working <a href="http://www.mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/draw/demo.html">demo</a> is a lot of fun. The linking/zooming feature is particularly cool, underscoring the goal of informal communication.</p>
