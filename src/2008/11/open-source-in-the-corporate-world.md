[Ted Leung](http://www.sauria.com/blog/) reflects on [open source and the corporate world](http://herdingcode.com/?p=57) in an interview on [herding code](http://herdingcode.com/). It is a bit long for the typical web attention span (over an hour), but worth listening to.

Notes…  
\* Companies benefits by releasing something that they know people want/need.  
\* Developers want access to be able to do something collaboratively with the product, to contribute code so that the next version will have the feature or bug fix they need.  
\* In open source, intelligence is distributed, so it is harder to kill  
\* Let people decide what they like, economic benefits accrue to the popular  
\* Ted wants to see as large a substrate for innovation as possible and sees open source as a way to do that  
\* We’re not there yet… people who are good at blogging cause their projects to be more widely adopted, which doesn’t necessarily cause the best stuff to win
