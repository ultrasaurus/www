<h1>puppylike accessibility</h1>

<p>I really enjoyed Paul Boutin’s article “<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2140635/">A Grand Unified Theory of YouTube and MySpace</a>.” He suggests that YouTube and MySpace have become smash hits <strong>not</strong> because of their social networking features, but because they are “easy to use, and they don’t tell you what to do.” Here are some highlights:</p>
<p>“Given up on BitTorrent because it feels like launching a mission to Mars? If you’ve sent an e-mail attachment, you’ve got the tech skills to publish on YouTube.”</p>
<p>“I think MySpace’s popularity has to do with its puppylike accessibility. A typical page looks like something a Web-enthralled high schooler might have put up in 1996, but with more pics and a soundtrack. I agree with design guru <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/dec2005/id20051230_570094.htm">Jesse James Garrett</a>, who says the site’s untrained layout sends a “we’re just like you” message to newcomers. That encourages them to experiment with content genres the site’s designers didn’t build into templates.”</p>
<p>“The easier it gets to use, the less geeky the Net becomes, and the more it starts to look like real life.”</p>
