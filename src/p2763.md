I love my new iPhone 4, but it is just not a very good phone. Today I signed up for T-Mobile and I’m going to see if I can use my very cool Nexus One instead and just keep the iPhone for development, demos, and learning Japanese.

On my Mac, in Address Book preferences, select “Synchronize with Google”

On the Nexus One, in Settings &gt; Auto-Sync &gt; your account &gt; select “Sync Contacts”

- [Google Contact Sync FAQ](http://www.google.com/support/contactsync/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=92997&rd=1) reports that the Mac Address Book sync happens every hour and also whenever you use iTunes to sync an iOS device
- [Salling Media Sync](http://www.salling.com/MediaSync/Mac/) for photos, music and other media — haven’t tried it yet, but it looks cool
