<h1>could learning to speak spanish be actually fun?</h1>

<p>I believe that speaking a second language can be intrinsically fun, but it often isn’t. I’ve been digging into the question of what we can do to make it more fun, more often. I think the trick is to learn in a social situation when you are actually having fun. To test this hypothesis, my <a href="https://www.mightyverse.com/">Mightyverse</a> friends and I created a card card game.</p>

An Immersive Spanish Language Learning Game" width="770"></iframe>
<p>It began as a <a href="http://blog.mightyverse.com/2014/05/making-a-game-out-of-learning-a-language/">paper prototype</a> for our next mobile app, which actually worked really well in person with simple cards. We’re still “play testing” the instructions and “helper” cards, if you buy a deck now you beta test the print-and-play even before it goes into production or if you live near San Francisco or Sausalito or are near me in my travels, give me a holler (<a href="https://twitter.com/ultrasaurus">@ultrasarus</a>) and we’ll set up some time to play!</p>
<p>We have met our fundraising goal, but our real goal is to reach 100 Spanish learners who want to play our game. We need 36 more. Can you help spread the word? If you blog about it or talk about it on your podcast or something like that, just <a href="mailto:feedback@mightyverse.com">let us know</a>, we’ll consider you part of our outreach team and send you a free deck.</p>
