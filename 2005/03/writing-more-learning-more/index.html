<h1>writing more, learning more</h1>

<p>“the web is making us more literate – better readers, better writers” writes Elise Bauer (<a href="http://www.elise.com/weblog/archives/000945ululate.php">Not Always On</a>). I agree wholeheartedly. I have found that keeping a blog has made me a better writer. I still find it challenging sometimes to publish even one or two paragraphs, as evidenced by the vast number of “draft” entries lurking in my movable type personal publishing system. Nevertheless, I have written dozens of blog entries while I struggle over the draft of a single full-length article that I’ve been working on for about nine-months. Without the practice of regular blogging, it would probably take even longer.</p>
<p>Bauer also writes about how the web makes us more literate by providing easy access to definitions of words, as well as pronunciation. I discovered the same thing recently when I was preparing to talk to a group of first graders about the <a href="http://www.flyingpaperclips.com/archives/2005/01/titan.html">exploration of Titam</a>. I kept reading about Huygens probe which landed on Titan, named after the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. I know a Dutch phrase or two but had no idea how to pronounce this name. The internet to the rescue! A kindly soul had wondered the same thing and after doing some research, he <a href="http://frank.harvard.edu/~paulh/misc/huygens.htm">posted</a> his findings. I am consistently delighted with how I can indulge my idle curiosity, as well as semi-serious scientific inquiry, with a quick search of the web.</p>
