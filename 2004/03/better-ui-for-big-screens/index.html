<h1>better UI for big screens</h1>

<p>“Our user interface designs do not scale well to the available screen real estate. Windows are hard to access on very large or heterogeneous displays, like Tablets and non-touch-enabled devices. Notifications come up where one is not attending, and windows open in unexpected places or are improperly sized for their contents.” — <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/vibe/">Microsoft Research VIBE</a>, Visualization and Interaction for Business and Entertainment</p>
<p>The Microsoft team presents a number of ideas for dealing with complexity across large screens. I like the idea of <a href="http://host130.ipowerweb.com/~patrickb/projects/dragandpop/demo/dragandpop.swf">Drag-and-Pop</a> which might help navigate even not so big. yet cluttered desktops like mine.</p>
