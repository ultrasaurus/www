Online video sites suddenly seem to be widely availablle. I’ve been checking out a few of them, and for the first time this morning, I saw a video worth writing home about:

The others uploaded by [pepevi23](http://www.clipshack.com/UserInfo.aspx?id=14542) are also quite nice. I’d love to know the origin of these, which seem likely to be commercials for a new phone that plays music or maybe pepevi23 is just a fan.

ClipShack was launched in June 2005 by the folks at [Reality Digital ](http://www.realitydigital.com/)right here in San Francisco.
