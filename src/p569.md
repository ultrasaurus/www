Today, we’ll follow modified steps, as recommended by [Matt Wynne](http://blog.mattwynne.net/) who suggested [refactoring to remove duplication](http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/174015#762387) as an extremely important step, and since we’re using the generate scaffold command, we also should remove unused code when refactoring as suggested in the original [Four Days on Rails](http://rails.homelinux.org/) tutorial.

1. Describe a feature
2. Execute the feature and Watch it fail
3. Write the code to make it pass
4. Refactor
5. Go to step 2

Now that we know some of the Ruby on Rails basics and are familiar with using cucumber for behavior-driven development, we’ll write the to do list app in the way we normally would, starting with the design.

Plan for today

1. [Design the application](#design)
2. Write the “task list” feature (using steps above)
3. Install RCov to make sure we’ve removed unneeded code
4. Repeat Step 3 for additional features

Design
======

  
I’ve mocked up this variation on the [4 Days](http://rails.homelinux.org/) to do list using [Balsamiq](http://www.balsamiq.com/) which is an awesome tool for sketching a design. By doing a design sketch, it is easy not to get caught up in the detailed look-and-feel and instead quickly mock up the features you want for your application.
