<h1>ClipShack: hot coffee dance</h1>

<p>Online video sites suddenly seem to be widely availablle. I’ve been checking out a few of them, and for the first time this morning, I saw a video worth writing home about:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.clipshack.com/Clip.aspx?key=7DD2CD188A5EBF62"><img src="http://www.clipshack.com/ClipLinkThumb.aspx?id=7DD2CD188A5EBF62" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The others uploaded by <a href="http://www.clipshack.com/UserInfo.aspx?id=14542">pepevi23</a> are also quite nice. I’d love to know the origin of these, which seem likely to be commercials for a new phone that plays music or maybe pepevi23 is just a fan.</p>
<p>ClipShack was launched in June 2005 by the folks at <a href="http://www.realitydigital.com/">Reality Digital </a>right here in San Francisco.</p>
