This lovely web application for choosing paint colors is linked from the [Behr](http://www.behr.com) home page and can also be found in Home Depot stores running in a kiosk.

Built in LZX and deployed with the [Laszlo](http://www.laszlosystems.com) Presentation Server, this rich internet app would be categorized as a “product configurator.” It is the most beautiful and compelling example I’ve seen.

I suddenly feel like painting my living room.
