Alex from Acunotes (?) demonstrated a cool library for adding keyboard shortcuts to your site. They use gmail conventions, which are essentially borrowed from vi, but the feedback from their non-geek users is very positive. (Some browsers eat control keys, so we canâ€™t use standard desktop shortcuts. They can do key-combos with shift)

My notes:

- competitive advantage for them, users like it
- open source, MIT license, GIT project
- 8k including comments :)
- nice intuitive interface, with concise scripting
