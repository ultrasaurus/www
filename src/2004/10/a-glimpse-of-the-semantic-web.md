[Infoblox](http://www.antisleep.com/infoblox/) is a nice [Laszlo](http://www.laszlosystems.com) app created in the [blogbox](http://www.blogbox.com/) style. It lets you aggregate a bunch of popular web feeds, gathering the information in a concise and pleasant presentation.

Its neat to see how the blogging community is supporting the evolution of the semantic web. A significant group of avid info-consumers and early adopters provide an audience for rapidly developed experiments.

Its getting to be common that companies that create human-readable websites that publish information or offer transactions also offer XML feeds and web services. The landscape is changing.
