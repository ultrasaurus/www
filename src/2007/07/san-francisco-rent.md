[Ethan Garner](http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/ethan) has been collecting data on rents in San Francisco based on [craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org) postings since Aug 2006. Based on this data, he has created a [lovely visualization](http://mullinslab2.ucsf.edu/craigstats/) of where the rental market is hot (via [information aesthetics](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2007/07/craigstats_craigslist_rental_housing.html)).

Garner claims to have created this project out of boredom, while a grad student in biochemistry at UCSF. I don’t believe it. He’s clearly got a passion for coding, and with the vast amount data out here on the internet easily mined or already collected, this guy will never be bored.
