<h1>chelsea highline</h1>

<p>I stopped for a couple of days in NYC on my way to Amsterdam for the Dutch Mobile Conference and decided to stay in Chelsea, which I had never really explored before this. I shared a cab from the airport with some locals who told me about the Chelsea Highline â€” used to be an abandoned elevated Rail line, and has now been transformed into a park. I posted a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67857234@N00/sets/72157633997171068/">series of images</a> on Flickr.</p>

Very New York.</p>
