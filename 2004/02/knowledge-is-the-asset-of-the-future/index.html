<h1>knowledge is the asset of the future</h1>

<p><em>2004-02-12</em></p> 


<p>“Knowledge is the asset of the future, and as companies transition to a knowledge basis, everyone in a company will start to move their knowledge into an executable software form.”<br>
— When Executives Code by Phillip Armour via <a href="http://www.dotnetindia.com/2004/01/when_executives.html">.NET From India</a></p>
<p>This interesting article in the latest Communications of the ACM can be found on-line by those who subscribe to the ACM’s digital library. Phillip Armour reviews a class for executives who have found that their manufacturing businesses have turned into software enterprises. Software drives processes which have moved off-shore. Modern innovation is in the business process which are encoded in software. He notes that “software development is primarily a knowledge acquisition activity.”</p>
<p>Many of the conclusions in the article resonated with me. In particular, I agree with the observation of “the two greatest motivators of the software developer: to learn and to create.”</p>
<p>“In businesses where software is the business or the means by which the business is conducted, the job of executives is not to stifle learning and creativity under a blanket of control and process and metrics and status reports. Their job is to create an organization that focuses these powerful forces, and fosters a climate in which they are nurtured and realized.”</p>
