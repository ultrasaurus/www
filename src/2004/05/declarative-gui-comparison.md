I’ve been meaning to learn more about XAML and was interested to see a very approachable app demonstrated in a [tutorial by Joe Marini ](http://www.joemarini.com/tutorials/tutorialpages/amazonwishwatch.php)(via [Sam Wan](http://www.samuelwan.com/information/archives/000203.html)).

Since I left my msdn subscription at the office, I decided to write the app in LZX (from [Laszlo Systems](http://www.laszlosystems.com/)) to see how the two compare.

The Laszlo app is 39 lines of code, while the XAML version is 70. While I don’t believe that brevity is all important, I do think it helps.

Independent of the academic interest in the comparison of the two languages. The Laszlo app will, of course, run in your browser today without the need to install extra software or wait for an OS upgrade.
