[Some](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/21.html) [folks](http://glinden.blogspot.com/2005/10/joel-on-web-20.html) [believe ](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=de6cdd75-81f1-4c1a-978e-e78509b814df) that the term “web 2.0” serves little use other than to perhaps attract buzz and VC funding. I agree there is no cohesive meaning to it. However, it is an effective shorthand for “what’s next?”

The web is evolving from its initial implementation of primarily static HTML web pages to a realm of distributed software and information that connects and empowers people. Web sites are innovating in 4 areas:  
\* user experience  
\* data exchange  
\* connecting people  
\* history

**User Experience and Data Exchange**  
While creating a great user experience and enabling effective data exchange between different pieces of software are not mutually exclusive by any means, they seem to be two ends of a spectrum at the moment. I spent a bit of time checking out [Web 2.0 or not](http://web2ornot.com) and was struck by the minority of sites that had any real attention to user experience. For several sites my votes were way out of whack with the popular vote. I believe that improving the human experience of the web is a big part of “web 2.0.” However, many folks who are building the next generation web are almost single-mindedly focused on publishing data in machine-consumable form and aggregating or integrating that data from various sources.

This data interchange is often called the “Semantic Web.” The Tim Berners-Lee vision of the Semantic Web is well-explained in his [Scientific American article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=00048144-10D2-1C70-84A9809EC588EF21&catID=2) from May 2001. He begins with a future scenario of Lucy and Pete, who quickly solve the complex problem of helping out their mom by finding a conveniently located physical therapist who is also covered by her insurance. By no means does this vision of the Semantic Web compromise the human experience. The mpotivation for maiking it so that data can be easily parsed and cataloged by machines is to enable software that will make it easy for humans to solve problems.

At the moment, its a work-in-progress. RSS feeds are represented by little orange boxes which reveal quasi-human-readable XML when clicked on. It typically requires human intervention to hook up one data source to another. Often the only way to create the machine-readable version is to find a techie with a text-editor (or to be one). The discussion is dominated by references to technical acronyms (XML, RDF, OWL, FOAF). The digiterati know how to transfer photos from mobile phone to flickr and generate an RSS feed to integrate into their weblog. Personally, I’m geekier than your average bear, but most of the time I can’t be bothered. I tire of installing software and configuring my web site. I want the computer to offer up simple choices that provide real benefits.

**Connecting People**  
There’s a lot of great work being done in creating technology that enables people to connect with each other and supports existing relationships between people. The Internet is inherently a communications medium, but the initial web implementation was almost exclusively publication, one-to-many communication. There are now quite a few social network web sites, focused on different types of relationships. Sites like [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us)
