Eric Karjaluoto argues that sometimes you just need to keep at it to gain great inspiration and creative solutions. He spent some time asking designers how they [beat the creative block](http://www.smashlab.com/files/press/beat_the_creative_block.pdf) and felt that he did get any really good answers. Then finally it stuck him: “these people don’t have a quick-fix, they simply keep working.”

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it looks like work” Thomas Edison

“The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas” Linus Pauling

“Amateurs look for inspiration; the rest of us just get up and go to work” Chuck Close
