I’m back in San Francisco where I can walk my dog in the morning and drive my kid to school. I actually went shopping to buy some of that fresh California produce I missed so much when I was in DC — perhaps I was just shopping at the wrong places.

This particular beet tempted me from the organic vegetables section of the supermarket.

I’m learning PhotoShop (again). I want to be competent with a wide range of tools — not just code. I indulged in the purchase of a pressure-sensitive tablet and experimented with the so-called pencils.

I’m collecting [tutorials and tools](http://stitch.es/stitches/629/Learning-PhotoShop) through my learning path. I was inspired by the [Lindsay Norman](http://lpnorman.com/) collection: [Web Design for Beginners](http://stitch.es/stitches/482/Web-Design-for-Begin).
