Stories about women, and also people of color or otherwise from an unexpected background are left untold. In addition to the outright sexism and racism that can limit opportunity, there is a pattern of subtle, sometimes unconscious, bias, where a thousand small and large omissions add up to a stark homogeneous landscape of the faces we typically see and read about in books and the mainstream media.

I’ve had the opportunity to dive into the some of the Smithsonian’s Archives through the new [Transcription Center](https://transcription.si.edu/), where volunteers are transforming digitized archival documents, mostly in cursive, into more accessible text. Prompted by one volunteer’s question about authorship, I bore witness to a [fascinating investigation](http://si-siris.blogspot.com/2013/09/field-notebook-mystery-triggers.html) that led me to learn about the lives of two Smithsonian scientists and their work in the 1960s: Doris Cochran and Doris Blake. More importantly, I learned about how archivists uncover the untold stories in history.

Throughout her life (1898-1968), Doris Cochran [struggled to receive fair pay and job title](http://cluttermuseum.blogspot.com/2006/08/women-in-science-historical-edition.html) for the work she did as a herpetologist at the Natural History Museum. Like many women pioneers in science and math, she did not seem to let such struggles inhibit her work.

To be Known, We Must be Named
-----------------------------

Doris Cochran’s less well-known colleage, Doris Holmes Blake, was a coleopterist (a scientist who studies beetles). In Doris Cochran’s NSF grant proposal, she referred to her travel companion, Mrs. Sydney Blake. When I first read the document, I thought it was a woman named Sydney. I was looking for someone else named “Doris” referred to in the travelog, so I initially ignored this note. The reference archivist who led the investigation recognized quickly that we needed to look up the name. Archivists typically have to do extra work to identify women because they are typically identified by their husband’s name in official documents. There’s a two step process to finding a reference to most adult women in the archives, whereas men are referenced by their name alone.
