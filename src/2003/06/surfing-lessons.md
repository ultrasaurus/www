I just discovered [Mark Pilgrim’s Recommended Reading](http://diveintomark.org/newdoor/). This nifty page lets you type in your url and generates a list of blogs you might want to read. It worked quite well for me.  
(I found this site thanks to a comment by [Baldur Bjarnason](http://www.unishade.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi) on [but’s she’s a girl](http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000056.html)).

I used to start my Saturday afternoon web surfing by posing an interesting question to Google, but lately I’ve been “ego-surfing,” as I hear its called, at [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/). While some bloggers strive to increase their readership, I don’t mind living in a small corner of the blogosphere. The few folks who do link to my site provide me with interesting reading. I’ve noticed that Technorati doesn’t think this page is a blog… how would it know?

From [The Truth Laid Bear](http://www.truthlaidbear.com/), I like the concept of the [new blog showcase](http://www.truthlaidbear.com/newblogshowcase.php) but alas found no interesting reading. I added myself to the [ecosytem.](http://www.truthlaidbear.com/ecosystem.php) I expect I’ll be categorized as an insignificant microbe, and that’s fine with me.
