Digital music has evolved beyond simply distribution. Napster, iTunes, and Spotify transformed our expectations of being able to find and listen to music. On a parallel track, services like Pandora pioneered new ways to find music and the evolution of social networks let us discover music from our friends. There are new services like [preamp](http://www.preamp.fm/) that let us discover live music in a city or [Spotify playlists](http://blog.percolate.com/2014/05/spotifys-new-ads-reveal-social-matters-millenials/) that let us express ourselves through music, perhaps a natural evolution of the mixtape.

Music also connects us to memory and provide a hook to learning about history and culture. We also have incredible music collections, which are annotated with “meta-data” which can often position the music in place and time, and sometimes provide interesting connections and links.

- [Internet Archive Live Music](https://archive.org/details/etree)
- [Wax Cylinder Collection](http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/index.php) digitization project

I’ve just started to discover new kinds of collections and interactive stories that create digital cultural heritage connections.

- [The Ballad of Geeshie and Elvie](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/13/magazine/blues.html?_r=1). New York Times article with embedded music tracks

I’m sure there are more out there and would love to add to these lists… just tweet [@ultrasaurus](https://twitter.com/ultrasaurus) or add a note in the comments.
