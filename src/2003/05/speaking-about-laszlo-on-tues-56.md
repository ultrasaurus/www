<u>Making Data Easier to use with Flash</u>

Will be looking at two new ways to work with data and Flash. The first presentation will be given by Paul Gubbay, during which we will get to see some of Macromedia’s latest techonology, the Firefly Components. The second presentation by **Sarah Allen will showcase Laszlo’s platform for building Rich Internet applications**.

Although this may sound like a highly technical meeting, both of these presentations will show new technology that enables an ever wider audience to work with complex issues easier. If you are just starting to work with more complex websites and applications or would like to learn how to simplfy your work flow, then you should check out what these solutions have to offer.
