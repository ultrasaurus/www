<h1>building unix package with autotools</h1>

<p>ever wonder what all those random files are at the root of some package source that you are playing with? and how exactly does the mystical <code>configure</code> command actually do?</p>
<p>Alexandre Duret-Lutz has created a fabulous <a href="http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/dl/autotools.pdf">Autotools Overview &amp; Tutorial</a> — well worth flipping through the first 19 slides (38 pages of the PDF since each there are “builds” of individual slides exported as multiple pages).</p>
<p>Later, at page 97, he starts a tutorial section, which I replicated in this <a href="https://github.com/ultrasaurus/hello-autotools">git repo</a> — the README has a little cheat sheet of step to set up and build the package.</p>
