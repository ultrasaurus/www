![](http://www.geekcorps.org/images/design/logo.gif)I just heard about [Geekcorps](http://www.geekcorps.org/) (via [sfwow](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/new-sfwow/) mailing list). They describe themselves “as a non-profit moving at the speed of the Internet.”

“Geekcorps, a division of [IESC](http://www.iesc.org/), promotes economic growth in the developing world by sending highly skilled technology volunteers to teach communities how to use innovative and affordable information and communication technologies to solve development problems.”

I wish they had been around when I had summers off and lacked responsibilities that keep me at home. It sure seems like a fabulous way to see the world. I thought I would write about them in case any of YOU might like to volunteer :)
