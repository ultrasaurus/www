<h1>generating an .htaccess file for wordpress migration</h1>

<p>So, I’ve been working to migrate my ultrasaurus weblog from Movable Type to WordPress (this one will come later). Since all the links were changing anyhow, I decided to move from ugly numbered permalinks to pretty links based on the title of the post. I only had a few hundred posts, but enough so I didn’t want to be doing it by hand. Since I’m learning Ruby and infatuated with it at the moment, I wrote a Ruby script to generate the .htaccess directives.</p>
<p>In case this would be helpful to anyone else, here’s the code:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language=’ruby’]<br>
require ‘date’<br>
require ‘find’</p>
<p>Find.find(‘./archives/’) do |fname|<br>
# puts fname<br>
date_string = “”<br>
title = “”<br>
next if File.directory?(fname)<br>
File.open(fname, “r”) do |f|<br>
f.each_line do |line|<br>
if m = line.match(“(</p>
<h2>)(.*)(</h2>
<p>)”) then<br>
date_string = m.captures[1]<br>
elsif m = line.match(“(</p>
<h3>)(.*)(&lt;/h3)&quot;) then</h3>
<p>title = m.captures[1].downcase<br>
end<br>
end<br>
end</p>
<p># for some reason my mt archives include some old drafts with no titles<br>
next if title == &quot;&quot;</p>
<p>oldfilename = File.basename(fname)</p>
<p># 1) remove chars that I think wordpress removes<br>
# 2) change spaces to dashes<br>
# 3) handle this case to avoid —<br>
# Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress – Miniseries or Movie<br>
# also avoid — which I saw in my data, but not sure why it was there<br>
# 4) remove trailing dash if there is one<br>
# Thank you ruby-talk http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/167299<br>
title = title.gsub(/[(,?!'&quot;:.+=/)]/, '').gsub(' ', '-').gsub('–','-').gsub(/-$/, '')</p>
<p># get the new path to the entry, like &quot;/2003/03/brand-new-weblog/&quot;<br>
date = Date.parse(date_string)<br>
newpath = sprintf(&quot;%d/%02d/%s/&quot;, date.year.to_s, date.month.to_s, title);</p>
<p># we want something like this:<br>
# redirect 301 /old/old.htm http://www.you.com/new.htm</p>
<p>output = &quot;redirect 301 /sarahblog/archives/&quot; + oldfilename + &quot; https://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/&quot; + newpath<br>
puts output</p>
<p>end # loop thru files in directory<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>
