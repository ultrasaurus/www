ChrisK at [Gliffy](http://www.gliffy.com/) writes [about a new service](http://www.gliffy.com/blog/2008/08/04/handling-snail-mail-in-a-virtual-office/) which will scan and forward postal mail via email. Using [Earth Class Mail](http://www.earthclassmail.com/) they can route email to the right person without maintaining and staffing a physical office space.

On the personal side, it would be awesome to never see another pile of mail on my kitchen table; however, the kitchen table eventually will always get cleared off whereas my inbox just scrolls awayâ€¦.

This seems like a great solution for small businesses, where there is no need for a physical office when you are just starting up.
