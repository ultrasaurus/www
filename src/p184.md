In the interface the music is foremost, appropriately taking up most of the screen real-estate. The controls are effectively tucked into the borders, with the most important ‘pause’ and ‘play’ displayed prominently in the upper-right.

side note: I think that the [Anthropomorphized Brushed Metal User Interface Theme](http://daringfireball.net/2005/09/anthropomorphized) (via Tucker) would be pleased to be part of the Pandora launch.
