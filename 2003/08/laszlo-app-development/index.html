<h1>Laszlo app development</h1>

<p><em>2003-08-05</em></p> 


<p>I recently spent some time with LZX developing a prototype app. I thought it would be interesting to write up how we approached the problem and show some of the results that are now posted on <a href="http://www.mylaszlo.com">mylaszlo.com</a>.<br>
<img src="http://www.mylaszlo.com/lps-v1/pablo/store/lz_screenshot.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The problem:<br>
– create an e-commerce app<br>
– 1 week (4 days days for me)<br>
– 3 people</p>
<p>It was natural to consider developing yet another Pet Store, but we were bored with that concept and perhaps other folks are too. We created a store, but chose to sell three varieties of pots: tea pots, garden pots and cooking pots.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mylaszlo.com/lps-v1/pablo/store/store.lzx">Pot Store</a> is a work-in-progress. It needs some attention to the design to clarify navigation. The graphical elements are pimitive and it is not a fully functioning store. However, it was a great learning experience and employs some interesting user interface ideas.</p>
<p>* The subtotal updates as you buy, with a small motion to draw the user’s attention. You can see a summary of what’s in your shopping cart with rollover, without losing the context of the catalog view.</p>
<p>* The catalog layout is an example of a continuous user experience. You can get product details without losing context. (I consider it a bug that sometimes teapots fly across the screen. They should all move smoothly out of the way to a nearby spot.)</p>
<p>* Shipping/billing Address in the checkout section conserves real-estate and minimizes screen (and brain) clutter by only showing the fields that you need. (click “ship to a different address” checkbox)</p>
<p>I’ve written up some details on my experience of the development process….</p>
<p>Day 1: Plan the project<br>
We created an <a href="http://www.mylaszlo.com/lps-v1/pablo/store/mockup.lzx">interactive spec</a> in LZX. There are 3 main sections.<br>
Catalog (you can click to cycle thru 3 pictures in the mockup)<br>
– feature product view, one from each category<br>
– broswe one category<br>
– product details<br>
Shopping Cart<br>
– subtotal displayed when cart is closed, pop-up summary on rollover<br>
– cart would allow you to change quantity, delete items<br>
Checkout<br>
– fill out name &amp; paymeny info<br>
– ship to different address (checkbox works in mockup)</p>
<p>We split the project into three parts. I would develop a layout for the catalog view; Pablo would create the shopping cart; and Yossie would create a simple database and the checkout process.</p>
<p>Day 2:<br>
We agreed on what queries we wanted from the database. Yossie created a simple MySQL database and some perl scripts that made the appropriate queries. I found 15 teapot pictures and descriptions. Pablo added the cool rollover subtotal feature to the spec. We each started on our parts.</p>
<p>I had never written a layout before, so I read the docs and looked at the code for simple layout and wrapping layout. I created some simple test files.</p>
<p>Day 3: <a href="http://www.mylaszlo.com/lps-v1/pablo/store/layout/testlayout.lzx">layout motion test </a><br>
I modified wrappinglayout to create my new layout, which would show the grid of teapot images. When the user clicked on a teapot, details would be displayed. The transition between views was a zoom, where te other images would shrink to make room. This was much easier than I expected and fun to write.</p>
<p>Day 4:<br>
After the layout was working with colored squares, I integrated the image data from the server. Next I needed to integrate the catalog layout into the store app. Pablo had done a nice job of creating a “basket” object, so I could easily call “basket.addItem” to hook up the “buy” button in the catalog view.</p>
<p>Summary:<br>
Pablo &amp; Yossie worked on the app for a few more days. Overall I felt we accomplished a lot in a week, especially given that Yossie and Pablo were learning LZX during the development process. It’s a bit scary to post something so raw and unfinished, but we hope that in doing so other folks can learn from our process.</p>
<p>As part of the development team for the <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com">Laszlo Presentation Server</a>, I believe it is essential that we experiment with using our software as web app developers. In creating a platform for rich internet applications, we need to develop not only the architectural design patterns of how to hook up data and views, client and server, ui to back-end logic, but also the visual and interactive design patterns that could led to a more usable web.</p>
<p>Feedback and questions are welcome, as always.</p>
