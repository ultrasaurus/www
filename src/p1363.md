start by writing “the code you wish you had” (James Greening, p 31)

using the [red-green-refactor cycle](http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html), you start with describing the code as you want it to be, this leads you to focus on the result when designing and frees your mind when you focus on the implementation since you always have a high-level goal that is clearly articulated. “This is a process not unlike music or dancing. You get into a groove and it moves very, very quickly.”

“If you can easily change your decisions, this means it’s less important to get them right” http://martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html
