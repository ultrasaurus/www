I’ve always wanted to learn to make nice shiny things in Flash. I had a need for an indicator light this afternoon, and did a google search for “Flash radial gradient shiny light” and found [Shiny Orbs](http://www.kirupa.com/developer/mx2004/shinyorbs.htm) — step by step instructions that helped me befriend the Flash gradient tools.

You can see the results of my learning experience:
