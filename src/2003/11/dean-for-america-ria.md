Howard Dean has made headlines for his use of the internet in his campaign for president. The “[Dean for America](http://www.deanforamerica.com)” website regularly updates the homepage with latest news and hosts the [official Howard Dean blog](http://blog.deanforamerica.com/). There is a web application for planning or attending [local events](http://action.deanforamerica.com/meet/) that tracks and publishes stats. *So far Dean supporters have organized 7,892 events across the country with 86,628 attendees.*

The latest addition to this site features a Laszlo [event calendar](http://cal.deanforamerica.com:8080/lps-1.0.2/calendar/index.html). You can zoom in on a week or a day or get more details about a particular event. Behind the scenes, the Dean organizers have a similar web interface for posting events.
