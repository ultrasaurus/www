<h1>rspec 3 upgrade: conversion of should to expect</h1>

<p>Upgrading a Rails app to RSpec 3, I appreciated <a href="http://jakeboxer.com/blog/2012/07/09/converting-to-the-new-rspec-2-dot-11-expectation-syntax/">Jake Boxer’s guide</a>. However, his regular expressions didn’t work in the editors I use, so I whipped up some command-line options that use the flexible unix utility sed.</p>
<p>If you want to actually understand the following scripts, I recommend <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/unix/Sed.html#TOC">Bruce Barnett’s sed tutorial</a> and remember <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/2008/06/bash-xargs-is-your-friend/">xargs is your friend</a>.</p>
<p>Also, there are a few differences with sed on OSX, so these may not work on other platforms.</p>
<p>I didn’t attempt to handle multi-lined expressions, so I searched my spec directory for “lambda” in advance and changed those manually, and, of course, found a few other exceptions by running my tests afterwards.</p>
<h2>Change “should ==” to “should eq”</h2>
<p>You’ll need to change other operators also, but this was a pattern that happened to be very common in my code.</p>
<pre><code>
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i &quot;&quot; -E &quot;s/^([[:space:]]+)(.*)\.should ==[:space]*(.*)[:space]*$/\1\2.should eq(\3)/g&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2>Change “whatever.should” to “expect(whatever).to”</h2>
<p>This also works for should_not, since it is okay to say .to_not, even though I usually see people wrote .not_to</p>
<pre><code>
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i &quot;&quot; -E &quot;s/^([[:space:]]+)(.*)\.should/\1expect(\2).to/g&quot;
</code></pre>
