<h1>self-evident truths</h1>

<p>“We hold these truths to be self evident…” are inspiring words. Encoding them into a legal framework has been a process. The Declaration of Independence included values of equality and the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>Unalienable, adj. impossible to take away or give up<br>
— Merriam-Webster</p>
<p>The authors of that declaration knew full well the dangers we face of those rights being taken away, and yet the first draft of the Constitution did not protect these rights. The first ten amendments were a good start, becoming known as the Bill of Rights. Over 200 years later, we still need to work to define and protect those rights which we believe should be extended to all people.</p>

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."></a></p>
<p>Many people are saying “it will be okay.” We need to step up and work to make that true. Things were not ok before the election.</p>
<p>It is hard to know what to do, but change is not a result of a single action. We need to think through what we may face, so we are prepared when we witness injustice. And we must put ourselves in situations and in company where we will learn and see and have the opportunity to act.</p>
