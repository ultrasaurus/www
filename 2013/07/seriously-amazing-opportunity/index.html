<h1>seriously amazing opportunity</h1>

<p>I am delighted to be spending the next six months at the <a href="http://www.si.edu/">Smithsonian Institution</a> as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/24/new-round-innovators-joins-us-government-tackle-big-challenges">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>. The program was created in 2012 by the White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp">OSTP</a>) to place experienced industry innovators inside the government to help streamline government, stimulate the economy and provide more opportunity for our citizens. Two weeks ago, I started as part of “round 2,” designed to build on the success of last year’s program.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian is one of several agencies sponsoring Presidential Innovation Fellows in support of “Open Data” projects. In May, President Obama signed an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-">Executive Order</a> establishing the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf">Open Data Policy</a> to make information generated and stored by the Federal Government more open and accessible, with the goals of increasing government transparency and efficiency and fueling entrepreneurship and economic growth.</p>
<p>At the Smithsonian, I will be one of three Presidential Innovation Fellows working on several initiatives to strengthen the Institution’s digital enterprise, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>building a crowdsourcing platform to enlist Digital Volunteers in the work of digitizing collections and conducting research;</li>
<li>identifying possible new technologies to speed up the collections digitization process; and</li>
<li>improving the tools the Smithsonian offers the public to search and use its digital content.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am honored to be working with <a href="http://www.jasonshen.com/">Jason Shen</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/jasonshen">@jasonshen</a>) and Diego Mayer-Cantu (<a href="https://twitter.com/diegomayercantu">@diegomayercantu</a>) on the team of Presidential Innovation Fellows at the Smithsonian.</p>
