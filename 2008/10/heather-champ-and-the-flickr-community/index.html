<h1>heather champ and the flickr community</h1>

<p>Chris colin <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2008/09/29/onthejob.DTL">writes</a> about how Heather Champ and the flickr team figure out how to define inappropriate content and how to handle it (via <a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2008/10/october-7th-08-blogging">Marc’s Voice</a>).</p>

<p>“The essence of Champ’s job, she says, boils down to defending this imprecise but holy ‘spirit of Flickr.’ Indeed, imprecision is an art here. The list of <a>community guidelines</a> is an assortment of lawyer-vexing instructions like ‘Don’t be creepy. You know the guy. Don’t be that guy,’ and ‘Don’t forget the children.’ If you’ve spent any time online, you instantly recognize these to be meaningful and clear edicts. Champ is only half joking when she says her is responsibility is to keep things from ‘encroaching on Flickr’s serenity.'”</p>
<p>“People become disassociated from one another online. The computer somehow nullifies the social contract.” It’s great to see a someone reminding folks that the social contract is still relevant online.</p>
