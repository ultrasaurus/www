<h1>a glimpse of the semantic web</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.antisleep.com/infoblox/">Infoblox</a> is a nice <a href="http://www.laszlosystems.com">Laszlo</a> app created in the <a href="http://www.blogbox.com/">blogbox</a> style. It lets you aggregate a bunch of popular web feeds, gathering the information in a concise and pleasant presentation.</p>
<p>Its neat to see how the blogging community is supporting the evolution of the semantic web. A significant group of avid info-consumers and early adopters provide an audience for rapidly developed experiments.</p>
<p>Its getting to be common that companies that create human-readable websites that publish information or offer transactions also offer XML feeds and web services. The landscape is changing.</p>
