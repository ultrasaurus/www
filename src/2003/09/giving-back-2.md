One of the reasons I started this blog was that I enjoyed reading other people’s blogs. I was impressed by the Flash prowess of [Sam Wan](http://www.samuelwan.com/information/) and enjoyed industry updates from [Jeremy Allaire](http://radio.weblogs.com/0113297/) and [Kevin Lynch](http://www.klynch.com). I noticed that often when I had a very specific technical question, I found the answer on someone’s blog.

Instead of being merely a consumer of useful tidbits, I figured that folks might be interested in my thoughts or in need of my know-how. What is every-day experience to one engineer is rare and specialized detail to another. When I kicked this thing off, I thought it would be more of a techie blog. As the “evolving ultrasaurus” tagline suggests, it is not what I thought it would be and it changes over time.

I may be an anomoly in the blogosphere, but I don’t read the so-called A-list bloggers, and I don’t strive to be one. Everyone has their own reasons to blog. For me, I like being on the W-list with other not-so-[invisible bloggers](http://cogworks.manilasites.com/2003/09/29#a2021).

I always felt that the internet was the inverse of mass media. Instead of a few information sources braodcast to the masses, there are a huge number of publishers. Frankly the credibility of TV news is not any better than your average web site. Even with digital cable hooked up to the TV, I’ve got way more channels on my laptop.
