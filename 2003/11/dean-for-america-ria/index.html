There is a web application for planning or attending <a href="http://action.deanforamerica.com/meet/">local events</a> that tracks and publishes stats. <em>So far Dean supporters have organized 7,892 events across the country with 86,628 attendees.</em></p>
<p>The latest addition to this site features a Laszlo <a href="http://cal.deanforamerica.com:8080/lps-1.0.2/calendar/index.html">event calendar</a>.
