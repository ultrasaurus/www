A preview release of [Laszlo Presentation Server version 2.0](http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/) is now available. Woo hoo!

- **New Component Framework**: All the components you expect in a web app plus a few more. This framework is fully laszlo-rrific — with the details you know and love from an OS GUI with all the cinematic user experience you’ve come to expect from a Laszlo app. The components support simple declaration, data binding, full scripting APIs, and keyboard navigation — whew!
- **KRANK Optimizer**: Every web engineer worries about performance. Here’s something for the Laszlo bag o’ tricks. This new “instant-on” technology allows developers to optimize an application so that it will start immediately once downloaded.
- **Live examples** in the Documentation: I use this feature all the time. With a single click you can modify and recompile examples.
- **Better and cooler data binding**: if you liked data binding and replication from v1, you’re gonna love the new $path expression.

The components were my main gig on this release, jamming with Bret Simister, Peter Andrea, and the gang. I think this may be the first component set created entirely in declarative XML. The complete source code for the components is included with the developer edition. You can check out a [component example](http://www.laszlosystems.com/lps/examples/components/style_example.lzo) which you change the style to see the components in different colors. The components use a new “Ultra Pixel” font created especially for Laszlo by [Truth in Design](http://www.truthindesign.com).
