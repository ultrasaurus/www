<h1>H&amp;amp;R Block home page in OpenLaszlo</h1>

<p><img src="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/hrblock.png" alt=""><br>
H&amp;R Blockâ€™s <a href="http://www.hrblock.com/">new home page</a> is a nice example of an <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org">OpenLaszlo </a>cinematic UI. It has a clean, uncluttered design with good use of rollovers to annotate navigational choices at the top as well as providing a large amount of information in a concise presentation for the various filing options on the lower portion of the screen.</p>
