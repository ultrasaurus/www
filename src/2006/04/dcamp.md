I just registered and volunteered to be a presenter at [DCamp](http://www.socialtext.net/dcamp/index.cgi) (d is for designers, d is for developers). I’ve been wanting to go to one of these un-conferences and this one seems to be the right topic for me — “DCamp, an unconference focused on design and user experience.”
