First taxicabs, then airports, now elavators. I was visiting an office building in San Francisco tonight and notice this infomercial in the elevator. it presented a mix of safety tips, news, weather and stockquotes. If I had stayed on till the 18th floor maybe I would have seen sports. I know I’m supposed to be into this stuff, but all I can think is… do we really need this in our lives?
