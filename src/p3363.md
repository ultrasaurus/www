If Noel and I wanted to communicate, especially if he was up late and I was keeping more normal hours, we could leave disk files. I could leave a file called “Noel, read me.” And then he would leave a note on another file saying “For Tom,” or something like that. And so we would read these back and forth. It enabled us to do what postal mail did, but much faster, and it enabled us not to have to call each other and wake each other up if we were sleeping or whatever. And so the mail system replaced that with something very similar to what mail is like nowadays. You log in, you say, do I have any mail, and it shows it to you, and you can say, “Well, I want to send a note to this person.”
