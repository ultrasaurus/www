When diving into gears, it was my assumption that I needed to think about how to detect that the app is offline and enter an “offline mode” that would reconnect an sync up the next time the user started the app online.

Matthew Foster introduces the idea “[To State or not to State](http://positionabsolute.net/blog/2007/09/google-gears-offline-detection.php)” before diving into network detection code for prototype. Also buried at the end of the [Gears architecture doc](http://code.google.com/apis/gears/architecture.html) is a good discussion if modal and modeless approaches.
