<h1>enabling freedom of expression</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/writing/future-is-not-the-past/future-is-not-the-past.html">The Future of the Web is not the Past of Windows</a>: XML UI languages are commonly used to accelerate and simplify development and distribution of desktop-like applications. Languages like XUL and XWT encapsulate the set of Windows UI elements, and the ability to rapidly assemble a Windows-like Web application using XML is valuable and has many advantages over building a similar application in Visual Basic, let alone MFC or Swing. Unfortunately, using XML as a way to assemble interactive components that are defined using classic GUI toolkits leads to homogeneity and artificial simplicity, and does not reflect the diversity of todayâ€™s Web. Freedom of expression is essential for a UI markup language.</p>
