<p>“I aim to change the myth around what is a geek and what isn’t.</p>
<p>“I think to me a geek is someone who is passionate about technology, who really cares about innovation and how to drive innovation and refine society,” she said. “That’s how I define myself as a geek.”</p>
<p>I really like to hear about people self-identifying as a geek in a positive way. Folks need to be more exposed to people like Padma Warrior to understand why they should consider diving into a technical career.</p>
