“I know you don’t write, but do you read?” my grandmother once asked me. These days I find myself reading several books at once. [All Consuming](http://www.allconsuming.net/) has created a nify gutter snippet that lets me keep track of and publish my reading list.

Reading lists should be viral. The blogging trend has created fertile ground for a number of sites that help people publish lists. I noticed this one on [mamamusings](http://www.it.rit.edu/~ell/mamamusings/). I like its layout — all I need to do is type in the title and my comments, then it finds pictures, authors and links.
