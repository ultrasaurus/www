Chunking, which is vital to–and indicative of–expertise, overcomes the “three limits on the power of reasoning common to all us mortals,” write Prietula and Simon. Our limited attention span, working memory and long-term memory sharply constrain the number of different pieces of knowledge we can consider at once. But dealing with a few large blocks instead of many small fragments lets us keep a greater volume of information in play at any one time. “A large part of problem solving,” they note, “involves accessing relevant knowledge from long-term memory at the right time, for use in working memory.” Chunking is the key to that ability. 1
