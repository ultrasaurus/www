I stopped for a couple of days in NYC on my way to Amsterdam for the Dutch Mobile Conference and decided to stay in Chelsea, which I had never really explored before this. I shared a cab from the airport with some locals who told me about the Chelsea Highline â€” used to be an abandoned elevated Rail line, and has now been transformed into a park. I posted a [series of images](http://www.flickr.com/photos/67857234@N00/sets/72157633997171068/) on Flickr.

Very New York.
