<h1>upc/ean number for amazon fulfillment</h1>

<p>Signing up for Amazon fulfillment for our new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/%C2%A1D%C3%ADgame-Spanish-Learning-Card-Game/dp/B00QRX0ZFO">Mightyverse card game</a>, I found that I needed a Universal Product Code (UPC) or European Article Number (EAN). Amazon referred me to <a href="http://www.gs1us.org/">GS1US</a> which sells 1-10 bar codes for $250, with an annual renewal fee of $50. Wow. That’s an expensive number, and a hefty fee for them to maintain a row in a database table for me.</p>
<p><img src="../../../uploads/2014/12/gs1-pricing.png" alt="gs1-pricing"></p>
<p>A quick google search later, I found dozens of companies offering cheap barcodes for UPC and EAN numbers. A $5 one-time fee for someone to generate a number for me seemed much more reasonable. However, it turns out that many of these are scams — selling invalid codes or ones they don’t own or don’t have license to re-sell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… if a company joined the Uniform Code Council (now GS1-US) prior to August 28, 2002, the Uniform Code Council’s membership and licence agreement did not contain any prohibition against subdividing the numbers… This appears to have been a side consequence of the class action settlement. The product numbers from these companies are legitimate, however they will only be valid for as long as the companies are in business.<br>

<p><a href="http://www.laurerupc.com/">George Laurer</a>, who developed the Universal Product Code in 1973, maintains a <a href="http://www.laurerupc.com/">UPC Blacklsit</a> and recommends this <a href="http://authenticatedupcregistrationdirectory.org/node/48">UPC registered sellers list</a>. Despite being on that list, I’m avoiding InstantUPC since they have an <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140721instantupccmpt.pdf">FTC complaint</a> against them.</p>
<p>After looking at a few sites I picked <a href="http://www.legalbarcode.com/">Legal Barcodes</a> which sent me an email with UPC numbers. It turns out Amazon does everything in EANs these days, but magically transformed my UPC into an EAN by adding a zero to the beginning of it.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone else!</p>
