You might think it’s because I started programming when I was twelve, but that’s not why I became a software engineer. I didn’t get a Computer Science degree because I had decided to pursue a profession in software engineering. I felt that I should have some kind of back-up skill that would let me find work, if I needed to. It seemed like a fair complement to my Visual Art degree. I thought programming was fun, but I didn’t think that it would let me apply my creativity to solve real problems in the world.

I thought everyone who wrote code would write it the same way to solve the same problem. It was a common misperception in the 1980s when I was in high school. Some people still thought we could split big software projects into small tasks that would could distribute to arbitrary engineers, who would implement small pieces fitting neatly together like some cogs in a virtual machine. I didn’t realize that many already questioned that assumption. The Mythical Man Month was written in 1975, but I didn’t read it till much later:

> In many creative activities the medium of execution is intractable. Lumber splits; paints smear; electrical circuits ring. These physical limitations of the medium constrain the ideas that may be expressed, and they also create unexpected difficulties in the implementation…
> 
> Computer programming, however, creates with an exceedingly tractable medium. The programmer builds from pure thought-stuff: concepts and very flexible representations thereof. Because the medium is tractable, we expect few difficulties in implementation; hence our pervasive optimism. Because our ideas are faulty, we have bugs; hence our optimism is unjustified. — The Mythical Man Month, [page 15](https://archive.org/stream/mythicalmanmonth00fred#page/14/mode/2up).

Large, expensive videodisc technology was bound to be replaced by the newer CD-ROMs. You could store 600MB on a CD-ROM — it was hard to imagine what we couldn’t do with such a large amount of storage! The Mac IIs now supported color and it seemed obvious to me where this was all going. Computers would get faster, memory and storage would get cheaper and software from research labs would be applied to create interactive books for everything from technical manuals to encyclopedias to kids books. I still felt that I didn’t want to be a software developer as a career path, but I still delighted in the

Several of my friends graduated in May and decided to start a company. This new company would create software to support publishing in this new medium. CoSA, the Company of Science &amp; Art, combined artists, musicians, writers and software developers to create an ill-fated multimedia magazine. I joined to design the human interface and, of course, write some of the code to implement it. I evaluated HyperCard, SuperCard and MacroMind Director. Primarily for performance reasons, we chose HyperCard with extensions to support color images and audio playback.
