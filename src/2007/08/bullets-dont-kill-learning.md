“Bullets don’t kill learning, but improper use of bullets kills learning.” –Richard Mayer

I enjoyed reading [The Cognitive Load of PowerPoint](http://www.sociablemedia.com/articles_mayer.htm), an interview by [Cliff Atkinson](http://www.sociablemedia.com/) with [Richard Mayer](http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/mayer/).

Richard Mayer relates several principles from his book [Multimedia Learning](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0521787491&tag=ultrasaurus-20&camp=1789&creative=9325) which are applicable to PowerPoint, as well as any type of presentation. While these seem obvious, I often find it helpful and interesting to have good sense boiled down to some basic principles presented in a handy list (is that the signaling principle?).

\* **multimedia principle**, in which people learn better from words and pictures than from words alone;  
\* **coherence principle**, in which people learn better when extraneous material is excluded rather than included;  
\* **contiguity principle**, in which people learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented at the same time or next to each other on the screen;  
\* **modality principle**, in which people learn better from animation with spoken text than animation with printed text;  
\***signaling principle**, in which people learn better when the material is organized with clear outlines and headings;  
\***personalization principle**, in which people learn better from conversational style than formal style.
