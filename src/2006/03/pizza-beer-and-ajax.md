Laszlo is sponsoring a [developer meet-up](http://www.laszlosystems.com/developers/community/event_060314.php) on March 16.

Those of you not privvy to the wild flurry of checkins on the laszlo-dev mailing list may not have heard that our oft-told story of LZX as a platform-independent language has recently been validated with a DHTML/Ajax implementation. You can follow some of the gory technical details at the blogs of [Max Carlson](http://blog.maxcarlson.com/), [Adam Wolff](http://secretartofscience.com/blog/), and the [OpenLaszlo weblog](http://weblog.openlaszlo.org/).

It is something you just gotta see to believe — the same source code compiles to either Flash or DHTML. Of course, the applications are pure Laszlo. As usual, the demo application doesn’t really look like Flash or DHTML — Ajax may be the technical term du jour, but this is **cinematic**. Check it out at David Temkin’s [etech talk](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2006/view/e_sess/8498) next week or in SF at the meet-up the week after.

Also, Laszlo developers! This is your chance to show off your projects. Sign up to give a demo or just come to hang out and chat about LZX or your latest cool interface idea.
