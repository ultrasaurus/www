<h1>quick videos with stupeflix</h1>

<p>Stupeflix is perhaps aptly named, but nonetheless a cool tool for putting together a quick video. I could see using this for a graduation slide show or other celebratory event that yearns for a retrospective, but when I’m not up for losing myself in AfterEffects for several days to make it happen.</p>
<p>The sign-up is very easy and I’m quickly brought to a screen which is pre-populated with images and a soundtrack. I created a video of this, just to get the hang of it.</p>
<div class="thumbnail">[![Stupeflix Editor - Video creation made easy](http://img.skitch.com/20090508-t528puwctp29ejust13trtycsm.preview.jpg)](http://skitch.com/ultrasaurus/bqupk/stupeflix-editor-video-creation-made-easy)</div>It’s a good thing they offered that, since once I cleared the screen to start my own project. I had a “deer in the headlights” moment while I stared at a mostly blank screen and pondered what to do next. (A few big buttons in the middle of the screen at this point would be a vast improvement to keeping me “in the flow.”) Admittedly, it only took me a few seconds to spot the “Add Images” button at the bottom on the screen.
<p>I found it odd that you can’t add a soundtrack till after you add images (there’s a menu under the subtle [+] in the upper-right of the image below). My first instinct was to start with a soundtrack. Nevertheless, I could upload a bunch of images at one and they’ve implemented the most fabulous upload feedback I’ve seen yet:</p>

I just lost my whole project. These guys are in serious need of a “save” button. Ugh.
<p>Nevertheless, I persisted in my quest for a quick video fix. I re-imported the images and put together a video in about 20 minutes, then spent 15 minutes looking for a sound track. (Thank you, <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/SPORESEP">Liquid Stranger</a>. The music is “Quota Tapeloader.”)</p>
<p>You can check out my <a href="http://www.stupeflix.com/editor/beta/5FLKfESGc8m9161qZzqz/">final video</a> and the <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/stupeflix-ktvu.xml">xml</a> that describes it. The effect are semi-randomly generated (with some effects depending on the number of photos in a group). I could control them, if I were motivated, by editing the xml by hand. It’s a neat way to give your early adopters a ton of control while your UI catches up.</p>
<p>Overall, this is really neat. Kudos to the <a href="http://www.stupeflix.com/about/">Stupeflix team</a>!</p>
