Meetings don’t have to be boring. There is so much going on to pay attention to, if you are interested: patterns to see, people to watch, meanings within meanings. To some this might sound manipulative or weird or just too much work. Personally, I love the fact that human communications is so much more than the literal meaning of the words we say. There is meaning in the space in between the words… what are we not talking about? what are our assumptions? what voices are in the conversation? are there any voices that are missing that should be here?

Key Questions:  
\* Have an agenda (even if it isn’t *your* meeting)  
\* Know your audience. Who got invited? Who showed up?

If it’s your meeting, be intentional with who you invite, it sends a message. Is it a responsibility, a burden, or an opportunity?

1. Why are we here? Who instigated this meeting? that person might not even be in the room.
2. Relationships you are creating in the meeting
3. What are you learning? What do these people care about?
