<h1>surfing lessons</h1>

<p>I just discovered <a href="http://diveintomark.org/newdoor/">Mark Pilgrim’s Recommended Reading</a>. This nifty page lets you type in your url and generates a list of blogs you might want to read. It worked quite well for me.<br>
(I found this site thanks to a comment by <a href="http://www.unishade.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi">Baldur Bjarnason</a> on <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/mt-static/blog/archives/000056.html">but’s she’s a girl</a>).</p>
<p>I used to start my Saturday afternoon web surfing by posing an interesting question to Google, but lately I’ve been “ego-surfing,” as I hear its called, at <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a>. While some bloggers strive to increase their readership, I don’t mind living in a small corner of the blogosphere. The few folks who do link to my site provide me with interesting reading. I’ve noticed that Technorati doesn’t think this page is a blog… how would it know?</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/">The Truth Laid Bear</a>, I like the concept of the <a href="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/newblogshowcase.php">new blog showcase</a> but alas found no interesting reading. I added myself to the <a href="http://www.truthlaidbear.com/ecosystem.php">ecosytem.</a> I expect I’ll be categorized as an insignificant microbe, and that’s fine with me.</p>
