Reading the news these days can feel like watching a car wreck ahead of you on the high way. It seems to happen in slow motion and you aren’t sure whether your quick swerve, brakes, or dumb let will let you avoid joining the collision. In a recent [warning about US depression and China implosion](http://blownmortgage.com/2009/01/15/analyst-warns-of-us-depression/) (via [@RonKJeffries](http://twitter.com/RonKJeffries)) I enjoyed the analogy to this Ken Kesey and Hunter S. Thompson anecdote:

> The ever egotistical Mr. Thompson was surprised that John Lennon had been murdered while he had not.
> 
> “I mean, I’ve pissed off quite a few citizens in my time,” Thompson said.  
> “But you’ve never disappointed them,” Kesey replied.
