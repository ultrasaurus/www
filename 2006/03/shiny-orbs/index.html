<p>Isn’t the Web grand? just makes a person want to give back… if you have a need for a shiny indicator light in your app, feel free to borrow <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/shinyorbs/red-orb.swf">red</a>, <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/shinyorbs/yellow-orb.swf">yellow </a>or <a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/images/blog/shinyorbs/green-orb.swf">green</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the simple pleasures in life that make all the difference.</p>
