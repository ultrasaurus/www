<h1>getting started with r</h1>

<p>I installed the “roasted marshmallows” version of R (2.15.1) from <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">www.r-project.org</a>, which went smoothly on my MacBookPro running Lion. I was happy to find its REPL ran easily on the command line in Terminal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R is a free implementation of a dialect of the S language, the statistics and graphics environment for which John Chambers won the ACM Software Systems award. S was consciously designed to blur the distinction between users and programmers. S is a high-level programming language, with similarities to Scheme and Python. It is a good system for rapid development of statistical applications.<br>
— <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/Rcourse/R-fundamentals.pdf">R fundamentals</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>R has amazing built-in primitives and libraries for what scientists like to do with data and incredible graphing options. I struggled to find good, simple resources to approach learning R as a programmer. I loved this <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fienberg/Stat36-315/SomeFundamentalsofR.pdf">tutorial</a>. Here are my cliff notes:</p>
<p>The most fundamental objects are vectors — basically an array, where index starts at 1.<br>
Names of objects are case sensitive<br>
Comments starts with ‘#’</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>n &lt;- 25
v1 &lt;- c(2,5,1,9)        # create a vector, combine a list of columns
v2 &lt;- numeric(4)        # initialize a vector of specific length (with zeros)
v3 &lt;- rep(3, 10)        # initialize a vector with number: repeat 3, 10x
v4 &lt;- 1:4                  # specify a vector using the range 1-4
v4 &lt;- 4:1                  # you can count down, 4,3,2,1
v4 &lt;- 3:-1                 # even to negative numbers: 3,2,1,0,-1
v4 &lt;- seq(1, 1.5, by=.1)   # easy to generate a sequence of equality spaced non-integers
v5 &lt;- c(v3, v4, 7)        # c will combine or concatenate vectors
</code></pre>
<pre><code>v2[1] &lt;- 4         # use bracket notation to access (or set) an element
v2[1:3] &lt;- 4:6     # you can even access (or set) a range
</code></pre>
<p>For those of us who already know it from Math class (or computer graphics), vector math in R works the way you would expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>when an operation involves a vector and a number, the number is used to modify each element of the vector as specified by the operation</li>
<li>when arithmetic involves two vectors of the same length, then the operation applies to elements with the same index.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding vectors of different length doesn’t really make sense in real life (although maybe there’s an application for that I don’t know about), but R conveniently defines that the shorter vector is repeated as often a needed to match the length of the longer vector.</p>
<p>Like many languages, and more importantly, like Math, functions are a name with its arguments enclosed in parentheses. Here are some common ones:</p>
<pre><code>max(v1)
mean(v1)
sum(v1)
prod(v1)
length(v1)
unique(v1)
</code></pre>
<p>By using parentheses for grouping, one can combine several expressions that involve<br>
functions.</p>
<pre><code>(sum(v2^2) - (sum(v2)^2)/length(v2)) / (length(v2) - 1)
</code></pre>
<p>A simpler way to get the same result would be to use the <code>var</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>var(v2)
</code></pre>
<p>The standard deviation is computed by using the expression <code>sqrt(var(v2))</code></p>
<p>Comparisons are cool.</p>
<pre><code>
&gt; 1  1:2  v6  v6[v6 &lt; 3]    # find all elements in a vector which are  length(v6[v6 &lt; 3])    # count how many are &lt; 3
[1] 2
</code></pre>
