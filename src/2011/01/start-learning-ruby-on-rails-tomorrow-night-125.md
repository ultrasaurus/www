Tomorrow night we’re planning an experiment in distance learning. If it works out, we’ll offer our evening [Blazing Cloud](http://blazingcloud.net/) classes with a (for pay) online option, but for starters we thought we would try out the tech. If you want to join us at 6:30pm for an introduction to Ruby on Rails, please join this [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rails-distance-learning-experiment).

The audience is people who already know how to program, but don’t know Rails. If you want to join us, you should install Ruby and Rails before you arrive.

- If you are on Mac or Linux, I recommend [rvm](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) for installing Ruby and Ruby Gems, use either 1.9.2 or 1.8.7 and then 
  - gem install rails
  - install git — you can use instructions linked from [here](http://www.wiki.devchix.com/index.php?title=Workshop_Installation_Notes_Rails_3)
- If you are on Windows, I recommend the shiny new [Rails Installer](http://railsinstaller.org/) from the fine folks at [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/)

Also, please create an account on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), since we will host our apps there
