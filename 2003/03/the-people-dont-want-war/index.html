<h1>the people don&amp;#8217;t want war</h1>

<p>“Of course the people don’t want war. But after all, it’s the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship … Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leader. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them you’re being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.”<br>
