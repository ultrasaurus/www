<h1>La Quinta mapping application</h1>

<p>The mapping application gives consumers a visual way to quickly and easily find a hotel. To try it yourself click “search by map” on the <a href="http://www.lq.com/">La Quinta homepage</a>. Be sure to check out the state of Texas, which has so many La Quinta Inns that a zoom in feature was needed. The coolest thing about this app is behind the scenes. When La Quinta adds a hotel, all they need to do is update a database with the name &amp; GPS location of the Inn and, with a little Laszlo magic, the app does the rest.</p>
<p>“Laszlo’s use of open standards makes it easy for us to integrate LPS into our existing architecture without added complexity or infrastructure costs,” said Raven Zachary, Director of Internet Technology at La Quinta Inns.
