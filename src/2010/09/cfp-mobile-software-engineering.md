Is there anything special about mobile software development or is it the equivalent to developing for a very small laptop? Do the devices and capabilities imply different patterns and processes? Are there any implications for research and education?

The [Workshop on Mobile Software Engineering](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/wmse/) in conjunction with MobiCASE 2010 will be exploring these questions. Martin Griss and Ray Bareiss from Carnegie Mellon are chairing the workshop. Iâ€™m on the organizing committee and look forward to hearing from other people in the field. At time I think the answers are obvious, but then find that other people come to different conclusions. It is sure to be an interesting conversation.

The call for papers has been extended till Sept 28 to invite additional participation. [Please join us](http://www.cmu.edu/silicon-valley/wmse/).
