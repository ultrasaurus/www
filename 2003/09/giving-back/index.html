<h1>giving back</h1>

<p>Before I considered writing a blog of my own, I found myself enjoying other people’s blogs. I found information that I wouldn’t have otherwise read. In the haze of internet commercialization, it seems odd to talk about giving back to the community, but this altruistic inclination was the #3 reason that I started this blog.</p>
<p>The internet has a wonderful history of people freely sharing their creations. As a backdrop to the venture-capital-driven internet boom, there were always organizations and individuals who contributed to shared community wisdom and practical software. From <a href="http://slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> to <a href="http://www.linguistlist.org/~ask-ling/">ask-a-linguist</a>, there are large and small communities that exists purely to provide information to like-minded souls.</p>
<p>It wanted to do more than simply lurk, but become a participating citizen this strange community of bloggers. I enjoy my small presence in an obscure corner of the blogosphere.</p>
